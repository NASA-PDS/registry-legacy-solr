####Bundle Organization:

#####Pioneer 10 Calibrated HVM PA CRT 1 Hour Averaged Data Collection

*  urn:nasa:pds:p10-hvm-pa-cal:data-merged-1hr

This collection contains Pioneer 10 Helium 
Vector Magnetometer (HVM), Quadraspherical Plasma Analyzer (PA)
and Cosmic Ray (CRT) merged 1 Hour averaged Data

Time Coverage of merged files: March 3, 1972 - December 31, 1995

A portion of the data were originally archived in the following PDS3 data set:

* [P10-J-HVM/PA-4-SUMM-MERGED-1HR-V1.0](https://doi.org/10.17189/1519771)

These data cover additional dates that include 1972-03-11 to 1972-11-26 and
1973-01-01 to 1995-12-31. These data were obtained from the data from the NASA Space
Physics Data Fascility (SPDF). The PDS4 product labels, collection and bundle products
were created at the Planetary Plasma Interactions (PPI) Node of the Planetary 
Data Systems (PDS).

Data files are stored in ASCII (.TAB file extension).
PDS4 documentation is all XML. There is an XML label for every product in the
archive.

#####Pioneer 10 Calibrated HVM PA CRT Document Collection

*  urn:nasa:pds:p10-hvm-pa-crt-cal:document

This collection contains documents associated with the
Pioneer 10 Calibrated HVM PA CRT bundle.
