ROSETTA Mission Overview
=====================================================================
 
The ROSETTA mission is an interplanetary mission whose main
objectives are the rendezvous and in-situ measurements of the comet
67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, scheduled for 2014/2015. The spacecraft
carries a Rosetta Lander, named Philae, to the nucleus and deploys it
onto its surface.
 
A brief description of the mission and its objectives can be found in
[GLASSMEIERETAL2007A]. A detailed description of the mission analysis
can be found in the ROSETTA User Manual [RO-DSS-MA-1001], and the
flight Operations Plan [RO-ESC-PL-5000].
 
On its long way to the comet nucleus after a Launch by Ariane 5 P1+
in March 2004, the ROSETTA spacecraft orbited the Sun for one year
until it returned to Earth for the first swing-by. The planet Mars was
reached in February 2007, about 3 years after launch. In November
2007 a second Earth swing-by took place and a third one in November
2009. Two asteroid flybys (2867 Steins and 21 Lutetia) were performed
on the way to the comet. These two asteroids had been selected at the
Science Working Team meeting on 11th March 2004 among all the
available candidate asteroids, depending on the scientific interest
and the propellant required for the correction manoeuvre. Around the
aphelion of its orbit, which is 5.3 AU from the Sun, the spacecraft
has been in a spinning hibernation mode for about 2.5 years.
 
Rosetta rendezvoused with comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in August
2014. The Philae lander was deployed to the surface of the comet on 12
November 2014.
The end of the nominal mission is planned in December 2015.
 
Please note:
------------
The ROSETTA spacecraft was originally designed for a mission to the
comet 46 P/Wirtanen to be launched in January 2003. Due to a delay of
the launch a new comet (67P/Churyumow-Gerasimenko) had been selected
by the Science Working Team on 3rd-4th April 2003.
The compliance of the design was checked and where necessary adapted
for this new mission. Therefore in the following all the details and
characteristics for this new mission are used.
 
 
ROSETTA Mission Objectives
=====================================================================
 
The scientific objectives of the ROSETTA mission can be considered
from three main viewpoints:
 
First of all, comets and asteroids are fully-fledged members of our
solar system, which means, that they are objects of intrinsic
interest to planetary scientists. The level of investigations
conducted on these bodies is therefore far below that achieved for
the other objects of the solar system.
The study of the small solar-system bodies arguably represents the
last major gap in the tremendous worldwide effort that has been made
to reveal our planetary neighbours to us.
 
The most important scientific rationale for studying small solar-
system bodies is the key role-play in helping us to understand the
formation of the solar system. Comets and asteroids have a close
genetic relationship with the planetesimals, which formed from the
solar nebula 4.57 billion years ago. Most of our present
understanding of these processes has been obtained by studying
meteorites, which constitute a biased sample of asteroidal material,
and micrometeoroids, which may represent cometary grains processed by
solar radiation and atmospheric entry. There is therefore a strong
scientific case of studying cometary material in situ, as it is
surely more primitive than extraterrestrial samples.
 
A third scientific aspect is the study of the physio-chemical
processes, which are specific to comets and asteroids. In this
respect, asteroids can provide information on impact phenomena,
particularly on very large scale. However, the increase in cometary
activity as these bodies approach the Sun undoubtedly represents one
of the most complex and fascinating processes to be observed in the
solar system.
 
Science Objectives
---------------------
The prime scientific objectives as defined in the Announcement of
Opportunity [RO-EST-AO-0001] by the Rosetta Science Team can be
summarized as:
 
- Global characterisation of the nucleus, determination of dynamic
properties, surface morphology and composition
 
- Chemical, mineralogical and isotropic compositions of volatiles and
refractories in a cometary nucleus
 
- Physical properties and interrelation of volatiles and refractories
in a cometary nucleus
 
- Study of the development of cometary activity and the processes in
the surface layer of the nucleus and in the inner coma (dust-gas
interaction)
 
- Origin of comets, relationship between cometary and interstellar
material.
 
- Implications for the origin of the solar system
 
- Global characterisation of the asteroid, determination of dynamic
properties, surface morphology and composition.
 
 
Mission Profile
=====================================================================
 
The ROSETTA mission profile results from the orbit of the target
comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, which has a perihelion close to 1.2
AU and an aphelion of about 5.7 AU, resulting in a period of about
6.5 years. A detailed description of the Mission Profile can be found
in the Rosetta Mission Calendar [RO-ESC-PL-5026] and in the RSOC
Design Specification [RO-EST-PL-2010].
 
The injection of the spacecraft by a single Ariane 5 Launch with the
so-called &apos;delayed ignition&apos; of the upper stage, was not directly into
the trajectory to the comet, because of the high spacecraft wet mass.
Therefore the spacecraft had to be accelerated by a sequence of
gravity assist manoeuvres at Mars and the Earth, in order to catch up
with the comet&apos;s velocity at perihelion.
 
The initially large distance to the comet at the perihelion of its
trajectory has been slowly decreasing after the third Earth swing-by.
At the intersection of both orbits, the difference in orbit
inclination and the residual relative velocity were diminished by the
comet orbit matching manoeuvre at around 4.0 AU Sun distance. The
range of the spacecraft-to-Sun distance was between 0.88 and 5.33 AU,
defined by the minimum Sun distance during the first five years of the
mission with the swing-bys at Earth, and the maximum Sun distance
close to the aphelion of the comet&apos;s orbit. The evolution of the
spacecraft distance to Earth over the mission time followed the
profile of the Sun distance superimposed by an oscillation with an
amplitude of 2 AU (+1,-1) and a period of about one year due to the
Earth&apos;s motion around the Sun. This resulted in a range from 0 AU
(Earth Departure and Swing-by) to 6.3 AU during the superior solar
conjunction close to the spacecraft&apos;s aphelion (see Solar Conjunctions
section below).
 
After the second and third Earth swing-by ROSETTA crossed the
asteroid main belt, which gave the opportunity of two asteroid flybys.
The asteroids 2867 Steins and 21 Lutetia, were encountered on
5 September 2008 and 10 July 2010 respectively. These two asteroids
had been selected at the Science Working Team meeting on 11th March
2004 among all the available candidate asteroids, depending on the
scientific interests and the propellant required for the correction
manoeuvre.
Between the major mission events, up to the comet rendezvous
manoeuvre, the spacecraft performed long interplanetary cruise phases
(up to 2.5 years) with several solar conjunctions (see Solar
Conjunctions section below) and the power critical aphelion passage
(last cruise phase). In order to reduce the ground segment costs and
the wear and tear of spacecraft equipment during these phases, the
spacecraft was put in &apos;Hibernation Mode&apos;.
 
Two types of hibernation modes were planned to be used:
 
* &apos;Deep Space Hibernation Mode&apos; above 4.5 AU: Inertial spin mode with
a spin rate of 4 deg/sec. The spacecraft was almost entirely passive,
except of receivers/ decoders, power supply, heaters and two
Processor Modules with one RTU.
 
* &apos;Near Sun Hibernation Mode&apos; below 4.5 AU: 3-axes stabilised mode
with the solar arrays Sun-pointing and the +X-axis Earth-pointing.
Attitude control was performed with thrusters and star trackers, based
on ephemerides; occasional solar array adjustments and ground
contacts via the medium gain antenna (MGA).
 
The final approach to the comet into its sphere of influence was
prepared by the rendezvous manoeuvre (RVM-2), that matched the
spacecraft orbit with the comet orbit.
 
A subsequent sequence of approach manoeuvres, supported by optical
navigation, took the spacecraft closer and closer to the comet.
After determination of the physical model of the comet by Doppler and
optical measurements, the spacecraft was inserted into a global
mapping orbit around the comet.
 
The &apos;Duck-shape&apos; of the comet was a surprised and a challenge for the
Flight Dynamics team. Three activity cases had been planned to orbit
the comet, respectively at 30, 20 or 10km. Finally, it has been chosen
to go to 10km.
Meanwhile, a board was selecting 5 and then 2 landing sites. The
chosen landing site were located on the &apos;head&apos; of the Duck Shape
comet.
The delivery of the Lander or Surface Science Package (SSP) was
achieved from an eccentric orbit, which took the spacecraft to a low
altitude above the selected landing site. The Lander release was fully
automatic according to a predefined schedule, and led to a first touch
down with minimum vertical and horizontal velocities relative to the
local rotating surface.
The first touch down reached the foreseen landing site within 50m
accuracy. However, the Lander did not succeed in harpooning and
bounced twice. It was stopped by cliff walls, which unluckily hid the
Lander from the Sun.
The Lander, Philae, had the time to operate all instruments on board,
during a phase named the FSS, First Science Sequence, before going to
sleep on November, 15th at 00:36 UTC. Upon the landing of the Lander,
the spacecraft provided uplink and downlink data relay between the
Lander and the Earth.
 
After the Lander delivery the ROSETTA spacecraft escorted the comet
until the perihelion passage and outwards again, until a Sun distance
of 2 AU was reached at end of the year 2015. The main scientific
objective during this phase was the monitoring of the features of the
active comet.

Payload Checkouts
-----------------
Payload checkouts were scenarios designed to allow Rosetta payload to
make regular health checks, to activate mechanisms and to monitor
trends through calibration tests. They were allocated in the mission
calendar at regular 6-month periods during the first 10 years of the
mission cruise phase. They were split into passive and active payload
checkouts. Passive payload checkouts were entirely non-interactive.
Conditions for the passive checkout were that it would:
a) not require any real time monitoring, b) run entirely off of MTL,
c) not require s/c specific pointing other than to maintain listed
constraints, d) produce minimal science data. Active payload checkout
operations were executed both interactively and non-interactively .
Conditions for the active checkout were that it would: a) limit the
requirement for real time monitoring, b) run mostly from MTL, c) limit
the requirement for s/c specific pointing beyond maintaining listed
constraints, d) produce minimal science data. There was more
flexibility during active checkouts and in addition payloads used
interactive passes to make any necessary memory patches and tests.

Solar Conjunctions/Oppositions
-------------------------------
Other mission phases, which resulted from the orbit geometry and
interfered with the above operational phases, were the solar
conjunctions.
Two types of conjunctions occurred throughout the mission:
 
* Solar Oppositions: The Earth was between spacecraft and Sun,
resulting in a degradation of the command link to the spacecraft.
 
* Superior Solar Conjunctions: Sun was between spacecraft and Earth,
resulting in a degradation of the command and telemetry link to/from
the spacecraft.
 
Table below shows the solar conjunction phases throughout the mission
with type, begin and duration of the conjunction and correspondant
mission phase. The phases are defined as the periods, during which
the Sun-SpaceCraft-Earth (SSCE) angle is below 5 degrees.

It can be noted that for archive purpose and because of the non
expected landing, which included rebounds, the Lander team provided
the data sets from wake up up to the First Science Sequence (FSS) in 5
data sets with sub mission phases that differ from the official ones.
The table below lists these sub phases:

The Orbiter instruments use the phase Prelanding (PRL) to deliver the
data from wake-up to FSS.
 
Mission Phases Description
=====================================================================
 
Launch and Early Orbit Phase (LEOP)
-----------------------------
Rosetta was launched by an Ariane 5/G+ in a dedicated flight (single
launch configuration) from Kourou at 07:17:51 UTC 2 March 2004. After
burnout of the lower composite, the upper stage together with the
spacecraft remained in an eccentric coast arc for nearly 2 hours.
Then the upper stage performed delayed ignition and injected the
Rosetta spacecraft into the required escape hyperbola.
 
After spacecraft separation from the upper stage, Rosetta acquired
its three axes stabilised Sun pointing attitude and deployed the solar
arrays autonomously. Ground operations acquired the down-link in
S-band using the ESA network and controlled the spacecraft to a fine-
pointing attitude with the HGA pointing towards Earth using X-band
telemetry. Tracking and orbit determination were performed, the
departure trajectory was verified and corrected by the on-board
propulsion system of the spacecraft.
 
The launch locks of the Lander Philae were released at the end of the
first ground station pass. Philae remained firmly attached to the
spacecraft by the cruise latches until its release at the comet.
 
Commissioning phase (1 and 2)
-------------------
Commissioning started three days after launch following the first
trajectory correction manoeuvre. A Deep Space Manouver (DSM1) of 173
m/s was executed at perihelion. All spacecraft functions needed during
the cruise to the comet, in particular for hibernation, were checked
and the scientific payload was commissioned.
 
Commissioning was done in two parts, as the New Norcia ground station
must have been shared with Mars Express and could not be used
by Rosetta from June to mid-September 2004.

[RO-EST-RP-3343] Interference Scenario Report
 
Cruise phase 1
--------------
Almost all the scientific instruments, except ALICE were switched off
while ground contact was practically not available. No payload
operations were done during this phase.
 
Earth swing-by 1
----------------
The actual Earth swing-by took place on 4-Mar-05. The phase ended one
month after the swing-by and the spacecraft was prepared for the next
cruise phase to Mars.
One passive Payload Checkout was scheduled end of March 2005.
Immediately after this flyby an Asteroid Flyby Mode Simulation was
performed using the Moon as a target. Some limited payload operations
were permitted shortly before during and shortly after this Earth
Flyby. Rosetta payload teams were given the opportunity to conduct
scientific investigation that included close approach of both the
Earth and the Moon and the AFM simulation. Any activities that did not
require the Earth-Moon system i.e. continued instrument commissioning,
were considered for later in the Mission, such as during the next
active checkout.
 
The instrument objectives are listed below.
 
ORBITER
 
  ALICE
    - Flat field calibration
    - Extended object scattered light calibration (Moon as the target)
    - Absolute solar calibration
    - Absolute flux and wavelength calibration (wide part of the slit
    to take in the Moon)
    - Door performance test due to anomalies raised during
    commissioning
 
  MIRO
    - Asteroid Flyby Simulation test
    - H2O lines in Earth (high quality data obtained but analysis not
    complete)
    - Radiometric calibration of the Moon

    - Because of technical issues OSIRIS was not operated during the
    Earth Swing-By itself.
 
 
  VIRTIS
    - Co-alignment M/H
    - Aldebaran target in IR (failed, boresight did not detect the
    target)
    - Absolute calibration using the Moon
    - Full disc Earth imaging including exosphere over one rotation

    - Checking of scaled values with known Earth values
    - Solar wind values comparison with other s/c
 
 
Problems:
 
  RPC
    - Loss of LAP science data for 41.5 hours (2005-03-01 19:00 --
    2005-04-03 12:30).

Cruise phase 2 (and Deep Impact)
--------------------------------
After leaving the Earth, the spacecraft made one revolution around the
Sun, and in the second arc from perihelion to aphelion made a swing-by
of Mars.
 
There was a solar conjunction for more than one month in April 2006
(see Solar Conjunctions section above). Two passive check-outs with
non-interactive instrument operations for about 5 days were scheduled
during the cruise to Mars. PC1 occured from 5/09/2005 to 5/10/2005.
PC2 took place from 3/03/2006 to 8/03/2006.
 
The NASA Deep Impact mission encountered comet 9P/Tempel 1 on 4 July
2005, which fell into the Cruise 2 mission phase. At around 06:00
UTC, the mother probe sent a 362 kg impactor into the nucleus with a
relative speed of 10.2 km/s. Rosetta was in a privileged position for
its remote sensing instruments to observe the event (80 million km
distance, 90 degrees angle respect to the sun). Rosetta monitored
Tempel 1 continuously (i.e. 24 hrs per day) over an extended period
from 7 days before the deep impact to 11 days afterwards (27Jun-15Jul
2005). The first 2 days ALICE observed the stars for calibration. From
the 28th June to the 15th July, OSIRIS, ALICE, and MIRO operated
observing comet 9P/Tempel 1 continuously. VIRTIS was on only several
hours around the impact. Maintenance activities were carried out for
COSIMA, ROSINA, ALICE.
 
During the Deep Impact subphase, the instruments had the following
objectives:
 
ORBITER
 
  ALICE
    - Baseline pre-impact spectrum. Comparison with near and long
    term post impact spectra. The comet was detected in all spectra.
    - Strong atomic lines of neutral H and O were detected throughout
    the observation period.
    - Two weak lines of neutral C detected on some dates. No change
    detected by ALICE in comet&apos;s UV spectrum as a result of impact
    - except for possible enhancement in C emission.
    - No evidence of Ar, S, N, CO.
    - Water production rates. Results TBC.
    - Dark histograms.
    - Calibration star before the encounter. Spectra of calibration
    star was used for calibration of the Deep Impact spectra and
    instrument sensitivity. The data was also used to look for any
    flux variations due to pointing/jitter (initial results did not
    show any evidence of significant fluctuations in the stellar
    count rate).
    - Memory patch (time synchronisation issue).
 
  MIRO
    - Changes in the coma composition induced by the impact.
    - Upper limit on the water production rate in the pre-impact
    phase of the experiment. Water production rate and albeit
    with low signal-to-noise measured in the post impact phase. The
    water production rate was less than had been anticipated based
    on models.
    - Detection of carbon monoxide: the analysis was not complete but
    so far no CO was detected.
    - Estimate of Doppler velocity.
 
  OSIRIS
    - Accurate photometry of the unresolved nucleus (no atmosphere in
    between) with complete time coverage. The time resolution was
    better than a minute around the impact and could draw conclusion
    about the evolution of the impact cloud during the first hour.
    The long term monitoring allowed determination of the composition
    and evolution of the impact cloud (water production and dust/ice
    ratio)
    - UV coverage that allowed imaging of the OH emission at 308nm
    (estimate of the water production by the impact)
    - Imaging of the coma out to at least 150000km from the nucleus.
    The effect of the impact could be seen in the images for
    appromximately a week (stereo reconstruction of coma,
    impact cloud).
 
  VIRTIS
    - Coma and ejecta composition and temporal evolution. But the
    outburst due to the impact was not energetic enough to reach the
    minimum sensitivity required.
 
Conclusions of the Deep Impact Observations:
 
The science objectives of the Deep Impact Observations scenario were
met. The brightness increase of Tempel 1 produced by the impact was
lower than we had hoped for, and as a result the comet was too weak to
be detected by VIRTIS. For ALICE and MIRO the signal was just above
the sensitivity limit, but nevertheless important measurements could
be achieved. The results of OSIRIS even exceeded the expectations, and
the first scientific publications were widely cited. The data
collected by the experiments on board Rosetta are unique because
Tempel 1 was monitored continuously over an extended period of time
(no day-and-night cycle in contrast to ground-based telescopes) and in
the absence of an absorbing atmosphere.
 
The following operations was done during the Passive checkout 1:
 
ORBITER
 
  ALICE
    - Electronic and software
    - Test pattern and stim test
    - Memory check
    - dark exposures
    There was no instrument anomalies. The door performance test
    showed nominal behavior.
 
  CONSERT
    - Consert Orbiter verification
    - Consert Lander verification
    - Consert Orbiter/Lander time synchronisation
 
  COSIMA
    - Self check
    - Target manipulator unit maintenance
    - Ion emitter maintenance
 
  GIADA
    - Run mechanisms - cover operations
    - Health check (all subsystems, electronics, noise and
    contamination monitoring, performances estimation)
 
  MIDAS
    - Exercising of all mechanisms (shutter, approach mechanism,
    linear stage, wheel, scanner)
    The test was successful and MIDAS is fully operable.
 
  MIRO
    - Regular exercise and health check of all commands in all modes
    - Regular dump of EEPROM memory to check for radiation damage.
    All objectives were met. There was no radiation damage of the
    EEPROM.
 
  RPC
    - MAG: instrument calibration. Undisturbed solar wind was measured
    to calibrate the offsets of the MAG instrument in quiet conditions
    (Hedgecock method).
    - LAP: instrument calibration.
    - MIP: Instrument checkout
    - IES: measurement in the undisturbed solar wind for calibration
    of its sensors and cross calibration with LAP.
    The PC operations were completed successfully with no change in
    instrument performance for MAG and IES.
 
  RSI
    Two frequency downlink driven by the USO and a ground station
    that could receive the X and S band signals.
    - Investigate the stability of the USO
    - Verify interaction with the ground
    Investigations of the USO data from PC#0 revealed that the
    behaviour of the USO was obviously not as good as it had been
    during the last USO test in October.
 
  OSIRIS
    - Exercise the instrument mechanisms
    - Verify the sanity of the CCD
    - Verify the focus
    No anomaly occurred.
 
 
LANDER
  Test of the Lander Platform overall performance
  Secondary battery monitoring
  Lander extended AFT
  CDMS EEPROM dump
  functional test for
    PTOLEMY
    CONSERT
 
The following operations have been done during the Passive checkout 2:
 
ORBITER
 
  ALICE
    - same health tests as PC1. Tests successful.
 
  CONSERT
    - same as PC1. Tests generally successful (see report)
 
  COSIMA
    - self check of all hardware sub-systems on operational voltage
    levels
    - target manipulator unit checkout
    - maintenance COSISCOPE checkout
    - emitter maintenance
    Tests generally successful.
 
  GIADA
    - Same as PC1 plus monitoring of MBS coating evolution.
    The cover operations went fine. There was no further contamination
    of the microbalances. GDS is not fully tested for light
    conditions. IS seems nominal. All HK values were as expected.
 
  MIDAS
    - same as PC1. Tests were successful.
 
  MIRO
    - Same as PC1. Overall success.
 
  RPC
    - Same as PC1. All performances checked were nominal.
 
  RSI
    - Same as PC1. The USO behaved very good, USO drift satisfactory.
 
  OSIRIS
    - Same as PC1. Generally successful. For solar elongation
    angles &lt; 90 degrees OSIRIS got substantial scattered light
    through the nominally closed doors. The scattered light observed
    during PC2 was unfortunately enough that parts of the CCD surface
    was saturated. This happened in spite of the large exposure time
    reduction that was made after PC1.
 
  VIRTIS
    - The check done were performed properly.
 
LANDER
  Same as PC1 plus functional tests for
    MUPUS
    CONSERT

Mars swing-by
-------------
The mission phase began two months before DSM2 of 65 m/s, which was
performed near perihelion. The actual Mars swing-by took place on
25-Feb-07. The minimum altitude with respect to the Martian surface
was 200 km. The relative approach and departure velocity was 8.8 km/s.
During the swing-by a communications black-out of approximately 14
min was expected due to occultation of the spacecraft by Mars.
Furthermore the spacecraft was expected to be in eclipse for about 24
min. The phase ended one month after DSM3. DSM3 of 129 m/s was
scheduled near the aphelion of this arc in order to obtain the proper
arrival conditions at the Earth. Two passive payload check-outs of
about 5 days and an active longer one of 25 days were scheduled during
the phase (PC3, PC4, PC5).
 
PC3 started on 25th August 2006 and ended 30th August 2006.
The following operations were planed during PC3. GIADA and ROSINA did
not take part in this PC.
 
ORBITER
  ALICE
    - Electronics &amp; software verification, test pattern and stim test,
    Memory Check, Aperture Door, Performance Test.
    All operations are executed as expected.

    levels, target manipulator unit checkout and maintenance emitter
    maintenance
 
  MIDAS
    - Regular health check and exercising of all mechanisms (shutter,
    approach mechanism, linear stage, wheel, scanner)
 
  MIRO
    - Regular exercise and health check of all commands in all modes.
    Regular dump of EEPROM memory to check for radiation damage.
    All operations are successful.
 
  RPC
    - MAG: Instrument calibration. Undisturbed solar wind measurement.
    Such data will be used to calibrate the offsets of the MAG
    instrument in quiet conditions (Hedgecock method).
    - LAP: Instrument calibration.
    - MIP: Instrument checkout.
    - IES: measurements in the undisturbed solar wind for calibration
    of its sensors and crosscalibration with LAP.
 
  RSI
    - Investigate the stability of the USO and verify interaction
    with the ground.
    The PC3 results were very promising and the behavior of the USO
    is as good as expected. The stability of the USO was still one
    order of magnitude better than anticipated before launch.
 
  OSIRIS
    - Instrument mechanisms, verify the sanity of the CCD, verify the
    focus of the instrument.
 
  VIRTIS
    - Both VIRTIS M and H were working as expected.
    - PC3 was used to verify the upload of a new pixel map for
    VIRTIS-H to be used during the forthcoming PC4 (pixel map allowed
    to drastically reduce the data volume).
 
LANDER
  - Test of the Lander platform to check the overall performance and
  Secondary Battery Status
  - Lander Extended AFT with short function
  - tests of some units and
  EEPROM
  - checks for all ComDPU units

Although several open issues were resolved in this checkout, several
issues remain open and new anomaly report were generated.
75% of the planned operations were successful. The 25% loss was mainly
due to OSIRIS that lost the majority of its operations.
 
PC5 is a Passive Check Out that started on May, 18th and ended on May,
23rd 2007. The instruments that took part in this PC are listed below:
ALICE, CONSERT, COSIMA, GIADA, LANDER, MIDAS, MIRO, RPC, RSI, OSIRIS.

Cruise phase 3
--------------
No check-outs were scheduled during the short cruise to Earth.
 
Earth swing-by 2
----------------
Daily operations started again around two months before Rosetta
reached Earth with tracking and navigation manoeuvres. The actual
Earth swing-by took place on 13-Nov-07. The perigee altitude was
13890 km. The relative approach and departure velocity was 9.3 km/s.
The phase ended one month after the LGA strobing phase. In this phase
the spacecraft got very close to the sun (min distance 0.91AU). One 15
day payload checkout and one 5 day payload checkout were also
scheduled in this phase (PC6 and PC7).
 
Payload Checkout 6 (PC6) was an active checkout where a target
independent opportunity to perform interactive operations and to
request spacecraft pointing was given to all Rosetta payload teams.
The active payload checkout 6 ran for 15 consecutive days starting on
the 13th September 2007 until the 29th September 2006.
All Rosetta payload took part in this scenario. Operations ranged from
a repeat of established passive checkout operations to extensive
software patching and calibration campaigns. Four instruments required
active spacecraft pointing during the scenario with nine different
targets observed. Pointing types were 7 stares, 2 slew scans, 2 raster
scans giving a total of around 176 hours of dedicated spacecraft
pointing. These were mostly for calibration purposes.
Overall operations went smoothly. Although several open issues were
resolved in this checkout several issues remained open and new ones
have been generated.
 
Payload Checkout 7 (PC7) was a passive checkout run form 4th January
2008 to 9th January 2008. Main objectives have been met with no issue
apart from GD. This issue was due to higher operating temperatures
resulting from the short Sun-Spacecraft distance.

Cruise phase 4 (split into 4-1 and 4-2)
--------------
In this phase the spacecraft made one revolution around the Sun.
A solar conjunction took place in January 2009 (see Solar Conjunctions
section above), together with another two conjunctions of the Earth-
spacecraft- Sun angle (Sun-Earth conjunction as seen from the
spacecraft). In this phase the spacecraft got very close to the sun
(min distance 0.91AU). This Cruise phase has been splitted in two
parts after the selection of the first Asteroid flyby which fell
in the middle of this phase. Cruise 4-1 was before the flyby phase,
and 4-2 was right after. Two passive check-outs were scheduled, one
during Cruise 4-1 and the second one during Cruise 4-2.
 
During CR4, Passive Checkout 9 and Active Checkout 8 were planned.
 
Payload Checkout 8 (PC8) was an active checkout where a target
independent opportunity to perform interactive operations and to
request spacecraft pointing was given to all Rosetta payload teams.
All Rosetta payload took part in this scenario.
The Active Payload Checkout 8 ran for 2 days (05-06 July 2008) plus 26
consecutive days starting on the 9th July 2008 until the 1st August
2008.
Three instruments required active spacecraft pointing during the
scenario with 9 different targets observed. Pointing types were 14
stares and 3 raster scans. These were mostly for calibration purposes.
 
Payload Checkout 9(PC9) was a passive checkout executed between 28th
January and 2nd February 2009. An RSI passive checkout was also
completed on 09th February. All but 2 of the Rosetta payload
instruments participated in the scenario, the exceptions being Rosina
and Virtis. Operations were limited to instrument health checks and
passive checkouts, as is the case for nominal Passive Checkout
scenarios. All of the operations planned and executed in the PC09
scenario were successful (as detailed in Section 3). Minor issues were
observed by 2 instruments (CN and RS) but none of these prevented the
successful completion of the corresponding operations.

Steins flyby
-------------
Asteroid Steins was the first dedicated scientific target of the
Rosetta mission. Closest approach was on 5 September 2008 at 18:38:22
UTC. Rosetta flew at 800 km from asteroid Steins. For the first time a
European spacecraft flew next to an asteroid, performed an optical
navigation campaign, and autonomously tracked the asteroid by means of
its on board camera.
 
The 2867 Steins E-type asteroid had been discovered on 4 November 1969
by N. Chernykh. Its dimensions have been estimated by [KELLERETAL2010]
to 6.67 x 5.81 x 4.47 km3, corresponding to a spherical equivalent
radius of 2.65 km. Its sideral rotation period has been estimated to
6.04681 +/- 0.00002h, its pole direction in ecliptic coordinates to
approximately Lambda = 250 deg and Beta = -89 deg with an error of
about 5 degrees [LAMYETAL2008]. Its albedo has been estimated to 0.3
in the visible and 0.4 in the infrared, both by [KELLERETAL2010] and
[LAMYETAL2008].
 
The two asteroids Rosetta flew by are secondary science targets of the
Rosetta mission, with comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko being the
primary science target. Therefore, scientific measurements of Asteroid
(2867) Steins had highest priority. Some calibrations were also
performed during the flyby phase.
 
The flyby geometry necessitated a flip in the spacecraft attitude
before closest approach. As a compromise between the incompatible
requirements to minimize the illumination of the -X and +-Y panels of
the spacecraft (flip as late as possible) and to minimize the impact
on the science observations (flip as early as possible), the
spacecraft flip was performed between 40 and 20 minutes before closest
approach. Rosetta&apos;s relative speed with respect to Steins was 8.6km/s.
 
The heliocentric and geocentric distances of Rosetta during the Steins
flyby were 2.14 AU and 2.41 AU, respectively. The one way light travel
time was 20 minutes.
 
The estimated accuracy of the determination of the position of Steins
in the plane perpendicular to the flight direction during the naviga-
-tion campaign was +/-2 kms for navigation with OSIRIS and +/-16 kms
for navigation with the NAVCAMs (from navigation slot on Sept. 4). For
the targeted passage through phase angle 0 at a distance of 1280 kms
from Steins, a positional offset of 2 kms would correspond to a
minimum phase angle of 0.1 degree.

The Rosetta first asteroid flyby was a success. The navigation
campaign produced highly accurate predictions of the Steins position,
and during the flyby most instruments worked without serious problems.
Asteroid flyby mode worked well, although with somewhat lower tracking
accuracy than expected.
 
Summary results per instrument during closest approach can be found in
the operation report:

Earth swing-by 3
----------------
Operations were essentially the same as for the Earth swing-by 2. The
actual Earth swing-by took place in Nov-09. The perigee altitude was
300 km. The relative approach and departure velocity was 9.9 km/s.
Phase started 3 months before the swing-by and ends 1 month later. Two
short payload checkouts of about 5 days each were scheduled during
this phase.
 
The phase contained the Active Payload Checkout 10 (PC10). The section
first describes PC 10 and then the Earth Flyby.
 
  PC10
  ----
  The Active PC10 ran for 18 consecutive days from 18th September 2009
  to 4th October 2009. It represented a target independent opportunity
  to perform interactive operations and to request spacecraft
  pointing. All payloads took part in this scenario, as interactive
  or non-interactive operations. There were approximately 425 hours of
  non-interactive and 68 hours of interactive operations. Four
  instruments required active s/c pointing with 15 targets observed
  (111 hours of dedicated s/c pointing). These were mostly for
  calibration purposes.
 
  More details on the results can be found in the report:
[RO-SGS-RP-0022] Payload Report Active PC10
 
  Earth flyby 3 (EAR3)
  --------------
  This was the last of the three gravity assists from the Earth, after
  which Rosetta increased its orbital energy, enough to allow the
  scheduled encounter with the asteroid 21-Lutetia and the rendezvous
  with Churyumov-Gerasimenko. From an operational point of view, the
  swing-by spacecraft operations were of highest priority, and both
  science observations and payload operations were only allowed on a
  non-interference basis with those. Keeping this in mind, Rosetta had
  the opportunity to perform special scientific observations of the
  Earth-Moon system, instrument calibrations using Earth and/or Moon
  and public relations observations.
 
  The criticality of the spacecraft operations left payload operations
  in a second place, provided that Earth is not a scientific target
  for Rosetta and that potential trajectory correction manoeuvres
  would force the cancellation of all of them. This is reflected in
  the fact that only six instruments took part in the operations:
  ALICE, MIRO, OSIRIS, RPC, VIRTIS and SREM.
  Operation scheduling was centred on Earth Closest Approach,
  which took place on 13 Nov. 2009 at 07:45:40 UTC, and overall
  operations went smoothly, despite some scattered events.
  According to the available reports, the EAR3 can be considered as
  fully successful.
 
EAR3 results are described in [RO-SGS-RP-0023].
 
Cruise phase 5
--------------
One Active checkout (12) was scheduled during this cruise phase.
It can be noted that Passive Checkout 11 were cancelled since there
was not enough time to include it between PC10 and PC12. PC 11 was
supposed to be passive meaning that it is mainly instrument
health check operations. PC 10 and 12 are active and more important to
preserve.
 
Payload Checkout 12 (PC12) was an active checkout that ran for 23
consecutive days starting on the 22nd April 2010 until the 14th May
2010. All Rosetta payload took part in this scenario. Operations
ranged from a repeat of established passive checkout operations to
extensive software patching and calibration campaigns.
Overall operations went smoothly. Numerous open issues were resolved
in this checkout, whilst several issues remain open and new ones have
been generated. There was a particularly noticeable and positive
increase in the success rate of payload operations, when compared to
previous Scenarios.
 
All results can be read in [RO-SGS-RP-0027] report.
 
Lutetia Flyby  (17/05/2010 - 03/09/2010)
--------------
The second of the flybys took place on 10 July 2010 to the asteroid
21 Lutetia, discovered on 15 November 1852 by H. Goldschmidt. Its
classification into a specific asteroid type had turned out to be
ambiguous and included the possibilities of a C-type or an M-type
asteroid. This contradiction made it an interesting object for close
inspection.
Closest Approach (CA) occurred at 15:45 UT at a distance of 3168.2km.
The relative fly-by velocity was of 15 km/s. The fly-by strategy
allowed continuous observations of Lutetia before, during and for 30
minutes after CA.
Images obtained by OSIRIS revealed that Lutetia has a complex geology
and one of the highest asteroid densities measured so far,
3.4+/-0.3g/cm3. Its geologically complex surface, ancient surface age
and high density suggest that Lutetia is most likely a primordial
planetesimal.
This is the second of the two asteroids selected at the Science
Working Team meeting on 11th March 2004 among all the available
candidate asteroids, depending on the scientific interests and the
propellant required for the correction manoeuvre.
 
The following operations took place around the Lutetia fly-by:
21 May 2010 - 9 July 2010: Navigation campaign (astrometry) using the
OSIRIS NAC and NAVCAM.
5 July 2010- 14 July 2010: scientific operations targeting the
asteroid.
The Lutetia fly-by was a success. The navigation campaign produced
highly accurate predictions of the position of Lutetia and during
the fly-by most instruments worked without serious problems (except
Rosina, RPC IES and RPC ICA). Asteroid fly-by mode worked excellently.
The objectives summarised below have been addressed by the instrument
measurements:
  - Physical and thermal properties, mineralogy and geomorphology of
    Lutetia from spatially resolved multi-wavelengths remote-sensing
    observations between the extreme UV and the mm-range.
  - Determination of the mass of the asteroid from Doppler
    measurements of the spacecraft trajectory.
  - Global shape parameters from light curves taken days before CA.
  - Search for satellite/dust particles.
  - Search for an asteroid magnetic field.
  - Particle and field measurements.
 
Results of the Lutetia Fly By can be found in [RO-SGS-RP-0028].
 
Rendez-Vous Manouver 1   (04/09/2010 - 13/07/2011)
----------------------
The deep space manoeuvre was carried out when the spacecraft reached
a distance from the Sun around 4.5 AU on 23-Jan-11. One passive check
-out (13) was scheduled during this phase. One solar conjunction of
50 days and one solar opposition of 37 days happened during this
phase.(see Solar Conjunctions section above).
 
--PC 13 (1st-9th Dec 2010 + 14th Dec)
This was the final Cruise Phase Checkout. A number of additional
payload operations were also executed, to close out pending and
essential requirements, and/or to configure instruments for the
upcoming Deep Space Hibernation Phase. Only OSIRIS did not participate
in PC 13. PC13 ran for 9 consecutive days between 1st and 9th December
2010. A RSI passive checkout was also completed on 14th December.
All of the operations planned and executed were successful. Minor
issues were observed by 4 instruments (Consert, Philae, Rosina, RPC).
Alice performed succesfully some instrument checkout.
Cosima did periodical maintenance and check its status.
Giada checked successfully its status.
Midas performed a normal passive check-out and an additional modified
one for Deep Space Hibernation Preparation.
Miro performed a normal and sucessful passive check-out.
Osiris did not participate in the PC13 timeframe. However, on 23-26th
March 2011 - post RVM1 - specific OSIRIS operations were performed in
order to prepare and configure the instrument for the Rosetta Deep
Space Hibernation.
The Lander performed some operations and Consert performed an unit
functional test; both were partially successful.
Rosina did not participate in the nominal PC13 scenario, but conducted
several specific operations immediately following completion of the
nominal PC13 timeline. A spacecraft slew was executed with RTOF
monitoring, to further investigate data observed during Lutetia
fly-by.
RPC PIU, IES, LAP, ICA performed checkout with some errors/anomalies
reported, which were considered as no problem for the instrument.
Virtis performed the checkout successfully.
RSI measurements during PC13 showed some disturbances. The cause is
unknown at the time being.
SREM performed a successful checkout.
 
More detailed results can be found in [RO-SGS-RP-0029].
 
 
Cruise phase 6    (8 Jun 2011 - 20 Jan 2014)
--------------
The whole period was spent in Deep-Space Hibernation Mode (DSHM).
Maximum distances to Sun and Earth are encountered during this
period, i.e. 5.3 AU (aphelion) and 6.3 AU, respectively. During this
phase, 3 superior solar conjuctions and 2 solar oppositions occured
(see table above). This phase ended with the Spacecraft wake-up on
the 20th of January 2014.
 
Rendez-Vous Manouver 2  (21 Jan 2014 - 9 Sep 2014)
----------------------
The RVM2 started after Spacecraft wake-up and until September 2014,
when the Global Mapping phase started. It contained the Near Comet
Drift (NCD), the Far Approach Trajectory (FAT) and the Close Approach
Trajectory (CAT). It ended with the transition to Global Mapping.
During this phase, Rosetta did a serie of ten OCMs, starting on the
7 May to reduce its speed with respect to comet 67P/C-G by about
775 m/s. The first, producing just 20 m/s delta-v ( change in
velocity ), was done as a small test burn, as it was the first use of
the spacecraft s propulsion system after wake-up.
 
--Near comet drift (NCD) phase (21 May 2014 - 2 July 2014)
  The following three OCMs form the Near Comet Drift (NCD) phase.
  They took place every two weeks starting 21 May. They delivered
  289.6, 269.5 and 88.7 m/s in delta-v, respectively.
 
-- Far Approach Trajectory (FAT)  (2 July - 3 August 2014)
  The FAT contained the next four burns. The four FAT burns was
  carried out weekly during July, and all proceeded nominally. The
  approach manoeuvre sequence reduced the relative velocity in stages
  down to 3 m/s.
  During this phase, the first images of the comet were obtained with
  the optical measurement system (NAVCAM, OSIRIS). After detection,
  knowledge of the comet ephemeris was drastically improved by
  processing the on-board observations. Image processing on the ground
  derived a coarse estimation of comet size, shape and rotation.
  The first landmarks were identified.
 
  The FAT ends at the Approach Transition Point (ATP), which is
  located in the Sun direction at about 1000 comet nucleus radii from
  the nucleus.

-- Close Approach Trajectory (CAT)
  Close approach trajectory operations started at ATP. The spacecraft
  distance to the comet was decreased to 20 nucleus radii and the
  relative velocity fell below 1 m/s. The final point of this phase
  was the Orbit Insertion Point (OIP), the point where the spacecraft
  started orbiting the comet.
  During the CAT, 5 landing sites were selected by the Landing team.
  Details of the final manoeuvres to prepare insertion:
    6 August: Rosetta was commanded to conduct a 1-m/s thruster burn
    (which ran 7 min) to change its direction and enter onto the first
    arc (of three arcs) of two triangular (really, tetrahedral) orbits
    about the comet.
    It is important to note Rosetta has not been captured by 67P/C-G
    gravity, and the continuing series of thruster burns were
    necessary to keep the spacecraft at the comet.
 
    Rosetta executed two of these triangular orbits, one large, at
    about 100km closest pass-by distance (Big CAT) and the second at
    about 50km ( Little CAT ).
 
    10 August: CAT Change 1 burn - a 6min:25sec, 0.88-m/s burn that
    pushed Rosetta onto the next arc (100km pass-by height).
 
    13 August: CAT Change 2 burn - a 6min:22sec, 0.87-m/s burn that
    pushed Rosetta onto the next arc (100km pass-by height).
 
    17 August: CAT Change 3 burn - a 6min:19sec, 0.85-m/s burn that
    pushed Rosetta onto a transfer arc, down to about 80 km height
    achieved on 20 Aug (CAT 4).
 
    Finally, with the next two burns on 24 and 27 August, the distance
    was lowered to 50km.
 
 - Transition to Global Mapping (TGM)
  On 31 August, Rosetta began the third and last arc of Little CAT
  and Rosetta entered the TGM, a set of two manoeuvres.
  The phase ended at 10 nucleus radii with ta relative velocity of
  0.3 m/s.
 
Global Mapping and Close Observations (10 sep 2014 - 28 Oct 2014)
The Global Mapping phase ran 10 September to 15 October. During this
phase, Rosetta went down to 29 km distance, a point when the
spacecraft became actively captured by the comet gravity, and its
orbit became circular.
 
At the beginning of this phase, the Lander team down selected 2
landing sites: the nominal and the back up.
 
A series of manoeuvres reduced Rosetta distance from 18.6 km orbit
(taking 7 days) to an intermediate orbit approximately 18.6 x 9.8 km
(with a period of 5 days). From there the orbit was circularised at
about 9.8 km radius, with a period of approximately 66 hours on 15
October, and the mission entered the Close Observation Phase (COP).
This phase provided even higher resolution images of the landing
site in order to best prepare for Philae&apos;s challenging touch-down.
The new orbit also allowed a number of Rosetta&apos;s science instruments
to collect dust and measure the composition of gases closer to the
nucleus.
 
On the 28 October, Rosetta conducted a thruster burn (82 sec from
12:59 UTC) that delivered a delta-v of 0.081 meters/sec. This pushed
the spacecraft to leave the 10-km-altitude circular orbit (following
the terminator line) and the COP. Rosetta started its transition to
the pre-lander-delivery orbit.
On 31 October, the mission control team performed another manoeuvre
to enter onto the pre-delivery orbit proper.
 
Lander delivery
---------------
On 31 October, Rosetta entered a pre-delivery elliptical orbit at
approximately 30 km distance from the comet centre. This orbit was
maintained until delivery on 12 November.
The orbiter performed its pre-separation manoeuvre at 6:04 on 12
November, which placed it on the trajectory required for separation.
The separation occurred at 08:35 UTC (the confirmation signal arrived
on Earth at 09:03 UTC). At 10:34 UTC the Lander activated its
transmitters and started forwarding its telemetry to the orbiter. At
11:08 UTC, this telemetry was received on ground.
Touchdown was confirmed for Philae at 16:03 UTC.
While Lander telemetry kept flowing towards the Orbiter, the RF link
between the two crafts was regularly interrupted, which was not
consistent with a stable landing. Other Lander telemetry gave
indication that the Lander had bounced after initial touch-down.
The link between Orbiter and Lander was broken at 17:59 UTC one hour
earlier than expected for the targeted landing site.
On 13 November Lander telemetry was received on ground at 6:01 UTC,
very close to the expected time.
 
During the descent, ROLIS acquired an image at 14:38:41 UT, from a
distance of approximately 3 km from the surface. The landing site was
imaged with a resolution of about 3m per pixel.
 
After separation, Orbiter operations focus on maximising visibility
with the Lander and acquiring data to reconstruct the Lander descent
trajectory and support Orbiter Navigation.
NAVCAM and OSIRIS, once in Lander pointing, acquired every hour until
touch-down + 2 hours. After that, NAVCAM observed every 2 hours for
navigation.
The following Orbiter instruments have been operated: ALICE, CONSERT,
MIRO, OSIRIS, ROSINA, RPC.
 
The post-delivery manoeuvre that has been executed on 12 November 2014
started at 09:14:58.1 UTC and a nominal end time at 09:19:53.7 UTC.
Rosetta was then on a 50 km orbit.
On 13 November at 19:23 UTC Philae started transferring data to
Rosetta. Link was lost at 23:08 UTC on 13 November, 40 minutes before
predicted time.
During this slot was commanded:
- ranging measurements by CONSERT (Lander Search)
- CIVA images
- MUPUS boom deployment and hammering
- APXS deployment and measurement
On 14 November at 9:01, Philae data were received on-board Rosetta and
immediately transmitted to ground, 48 minutes after expected time. The
visibility period finished at 11:47 UTC on 14 November, 50 minutes
earlier than predicted.
During this period was commanded:
- APXS released but measured copper thus revealing that the door had
  not opened.
- MUPUS deployment was successful, hammering took place, SESAME
  detected it
- Drill activation for sample return to COSAC
- PTOLEMY/COSAC spectra acquisitions
- CIVA image but dark.................................................
- Consert ranging
The fourth and last Philae visibility period started on 14 November at
22:15 UTC ground time. The LAnder bus voltage appeared to decrease
rapidly. On November 15 at 00:07, the link between Orbiter and Lander
broke.
Among the Lander operations carried out during the fourth visibility
period was a rotation of the Lander to increase the illumination of
its solar arrays.
 
After the planned Touch Down, the Lander did not anchor and bounced.
We estimated that the first TD was:
    Time UTC: 15:34:06
    Comet-fixed coordinates: [2.129171, -0.961358, 0.498268] km
The NAVCAM image, the NAC image and the first TD as the starting point
gave the following impact point at:
    Time UTC: 16:26:23
    Comet-fixed coordinates: [2.450, -0.511, -0.242] km
This point has an uncertainty of 7 minutes. The position is also
uncertain.
By using three WAC images, the second TD can be deduced:
    Time UTC: 17:31:10
    Comet-fixed coordinates: [2.275, 0.249, -0.444] km
Consert Ranging estimated a final landing site at
Comet-fixed coordinates: [2.446, -0.055, -0.360] km
 
After Touch Down, began the First Science Sequence (FSS) where all
Lander instruments operated on the primary battery. The operations
did not go as planned due to the several TDs but occurred as listed
above. The Long Term Science Phase should have started after the
primary battery died, but the final TD let the Lander in a location
where the illumination condition could not allow battery charging.
Contact was lost on 15 November 2014 at 00:07, ending the FSS, and the
Lander went asleep.
 
Escort phase
------------
Planning period during the comet phase were approximately monthly and
allowed changes in trajectory types every two weeks. The table below
summarises the trajectory followed by Rosetta after the Landing:
21 Nov - 3  Dec 2014  |  Bound Orbits at 30 km
3  Dec - 6  Dec 2014  |  Transition
6  Dec - 19 Dec 2014  |  Bound Orbit at 20 km

Orbiter Experiments
=====================================================================
 
ALICE
-----
ALICE, an Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer, characterise the
composition of the nucleus and coma, and the nucleus/coma coupling of
comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. This is accomplished through the
observation of spectral features in the extreme and far ultraviolet
(EUV/FUV) spectral regions from 70 to 205 nm.
 
ALICE make measurements of noble gas abundances in the coma, the
atomic budget in the coma, and major ion abundances in the tail and
in the region where solar wind particles interact with the ionosphere
of the comet. ALICE determine the production rates, variability,
and structure of H2O and CO, and CO2 gas surrounding the nucleus and
the far-UV properties of solid grains in the coma.
 
ALICE studied Mars and the Rosetta asteroid flyby targets while en
route to Churyumov- Gerasimenko. ALICE also map the cometary nucleus
in the FUV
 
Instrument References: [STERNETAL2007]
 
CONSERT
-------
CONSERT (Comet Nucleus Sounding Experiment by Radio wave
Transmission) is an experiment that perform tomography of the
comet nucleus revealing its internal structure. CONSERT operates as a
time domain transponder between the Lander on the comet surface and
the Orbiter. A radio signal passes from the orbiting component of the
instrument to the component on the comet surface and is then
immediately transmitted back to its source, the idea being to
establish a radio link that passes through the comet nucleus. The
varying propagation delay as the radio waves pass through different
parts of the cometary nucleus is used to determine the dielectric
properties of the nuclear material. Many properties of the comet
nucleus is examined as its overall structural homogeneity, the average
 size of the sub-structures (Cometesimals) and the number and
 thickness of the various layers beneath the surface.
 
Instrument References: [KOFMANETAL2007]
 
COSIMA
------
The Cometary Secondary Ion Mass Analyser is a secondary ion mass
spectrometer equipped with a dust collector, a primary ion gun, and
an optical microscope for target characterization. Dust from the near
comet environment is collected on a target. The target is then moved
under a microscope where the positions of any dust particles are
determined. The cometary dust particles are then bombarded with pulses
of indium ions from the primary ion gun. The resulting secondary ions
are extracted into the time-of-flight mass spectrometer.
 
Instrument References: [KISSELETAL2007]
 
GIADA
-----
The Grain Impact Analyser and Dust Accumulator measures the
scalar velocity, size and momentum of dust particles in the coma of
the comet using an optical grain detection system and a mechanical
grain impact sensor. Five microbalances measure the amount of
dust collected as the spacecraft orbits the comet.
 
Instrument References: [COLANGELIETAL2007]
 
MIDAS
-----
The Micro-Imaging Dust Analysis System is intended for the
microtextural and statistical analysis of cometary dust particles.
The instrument is based on the technique of atomic force microscopy.
This technique, under the conditions prevailing at the Rosetta
Orbiter permits textural and other analysis of dust particles to be
performed down to a spatial resolution of 4nm.
 
Instrument References: [RIEDLERETAL2007]
 
MIRO
----
MIRO (Microwave Instrument for the Rosetta Orbiter) is composed of a
millimetre wave mixer receiver and a submillimetre heterodyne
receiver. The submillimetre wave receiver provides both broad band
continuum and high resolution spectroscopic data, whereas the
millimetre wave receiver provides continuum data only.
 
MIRO measures the near surface temperature of the comet, allowing
estimation of the thermal and electrical properties of the surface.
In addition, the spectrometer portion of MIRO allows measurements
of water, carbon monoxide, ammonia, and methanol in the comet coma.
 
Instrument References: [GULKISETAL2007]
 
OSIRIS
------
OSIRIS (Optical, Spectroscopic, and Infrared Remote Imaging System)
is a dual camera imaging system operating in the visible, near
infrared and near ultraviolet wavelength ranges. OSIRIS consists of
two independent camera systems sharing common electronics. The narrow
angle camera is designed to produce high spatial resolution images of
the nucleus of the target comet. The wide angle camera has a wide
field of view and high straylight rejection to image the dust and gas
directly above the surface of the nucleus of the target comet. Each
camera is equipped with filter wheels to allow selection of imaging
wavelengths for various purposes. The spectroscopic and wider band
infrared imaging capabilities originally proposed and incorporated in
the instrument name were descoped during development.
 
Instrument References: [KELLERETAL2006]
 
ROSINA
------
ROSINA (Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis)
consists of two mass spectrometers, since no one technique is able to
achieve the resolution and accuracy required to fulfil the ROSETTA
mission goals over the range of molecular masses under analysis. In
addition, two pressure gauges provide density and velocity data for
the cometary gas.
 
The two mass analysers are:
* A double focusing magnetic mass spectrometer with a mass range of 1
- 100 amu and a mass resolution of 3000 at 1 % peak height, optimised
for very high mass resolution and large dynamic range
* A reflectron type time-of-flight mass spectrometer with a mass
range of 1 -300 amu and a mass resolution better than 500 at 1 % peak
height, optimised for high sensitivity over a very broad mass range
 
Instrument References: [BALSIGERETAL2007]
 
RPC
---
RPC (Rosetta Plasma Consortium) is a set of five sensors sharing a
common electrical and data interface with the Rosetta orbiter. The
RPC sensors are designed to make complementary measurements of the
plasma environment around the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.
 
The RPC sensors are:
* ICA: an Ion Composition Analyser, which measures the three-
  dimensional velocity distribution and mass distribution of positive
  ions;
* IES: an Ion and Electron Sensor, which simultaneously measures
  the flux of electrons and ions in the plasma surrounding the comet;
* LAP: a Langmuir Probe, which measures the density, temperature
  and flow velocity of the cometary plasma;
* MAG: a Fluxgate Magnetometer, which measures the magnetic field
  in the region where the solar wind plasma interacts with the comet;
  Instrument References: [GLASSMEIERETAL2007B]
* MIP: a Mutual Impedance Probe, which derives the electron gas
  density, temperature, and drift velocity in the inner coma of the
  comet.

RSI
---
RSI (Radio Science Investigation) makes use of the communication
system that the Rosetta spacecraft uses to communicate with the
ground stations on Earth. Either one-way or two-way radio links can
be used for the investigations. In the one-way case, a signal
generated by an ultra-stable oscillator on the spacecraft is received
on earth for analysis. In the two way case, a signal transmitted from
the ground station is transmitted back to Earth by the spacecraft. In
either case, the downlink may be performed in either X-band or both X
-band and S-band.
 
RSI investigates the nondispersive frequency shifts (classical
Doppler) and dispersive frequency shifts (due to the ionised
propagation medium), the signal power and the polarization of the
radio carrier waves. Variations in these parameters yields
information on the motion of the spacecraft, the perturbing forces
acting on the spacecraft and the propagation medium.
 
Instrument References: [PAETZOLDETAL2007]
 
VIRTIS
------
VIRTIS (Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer) is an
imaging spectrometer that combines three data channels in one
instrument. Two of the data channels are committed to spectral
mapping and are housed in the Mapper optical subsystem. The third
channel is devoted solely to spectroscopy and is housed in the High
resolution optical subsystem.
 
The mapping channel optical system is a Shafer telescope consisting
of five aluminium mirrors mounted on an aluminium optical bench. The
mapping channel uses a silicon charge coupled device (CCD) to detect
wavelengths from 0.25 micron to 1 micron and a mercury cadmium
telluride (HgCdTe) infrared focal plane array (IRFPA) to detect from
0.95 micron to 5 microns.
 
The high resolution channel is an echelle spectrometer. The incident
light is collected by an off-axis parabolic mirror and then
collimated by another off-axis parabola before entering a cross-
dispersion prism. After exiting the prism, the light is diffracted by
a flat reflection grating, which disperses the light in a direction
perpendicular to the prism dispersion. The high-resolution channel
employs a HgCdTe IRFPA to perform detection from 2 to 5 microns.
 
Instrument References: [CORADINIETAL2007]
 
SREM
----
The Standard Radiation Environment Monitor (SREM) is a monitor-class
instrument intended for space radiation environment characterisation
and radiation housekeeping purposes. SREM provides continuous
directional, temporal, and spectral data of high-energy electron,
proton, and cosmic ray fluxes encountered along the orbit of the
spacecraft, as well as measurements of the total accumulated
radiation dose absorbed by SREM itself.
 
This instrument is a facility monitor flown on several ESA
spacecrafts. It is not considered as a PI (Principal Investigator)
instrument.

LANDER (PHILAE)
=====================================================================
 
The 100 kg Rosetta Lander, named Philae, is the first spacecraft
ever to make a soft landing on the surface of a comet nucleus. The
Lander is provided by a European consortium under the leadership of
the German Aerospace Research Institute (DLR) and the French Space
Research Center (CNES). Other members of the consortium are ESA and
institutes from Austria, Finland, France, Hungary, Ireland, Italy and
the UK. A descripion of the Lander can be found in [RO-EST-RS-3020].
 
The box-shaped Lander was carried in piggyback fashion on the side of
the Orbiter until it arrived at Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Once
the Orbiter was aligned correctly, the ground station commanded the
Lander to self-eject from the main spacecraft and unfold its three
legs, ready for a gentle touch down at the end of the ballistic
descent. The Landing is described above.
 
Immediately after touchdown, a harpoon was supposed to fire to anchor
the Lander to the ground and prevent it escaping from the comet&apos;s
extremely weak gravity. The system did not work and the Lander bounced
several times.
 
Science Objectives
------------------
It is the general aim of the scientific experiments carried and
operated by the Rosetta Lander to obtain a first in situ composition
analysis of primitive material from the early solar system, to study
the composition and structure of a cometary nucleus, reflecting
growth processes in the early solar system, to provide ground truth
data for the Rosetta Orbiter experiments and to investigate dynamic
processes leading to changes in cometary activity.
 
The primary objective of the Rosetta Lander mission is the in situ
investigation of the elemental, isotopic, molecular and mineralogic
composition and the morphology of early solar system material as it
is preserved in the cometary nucleus. Measurement of the absorption
and phase shift of electromagnetic waves penetrating the comet
nucleus will help to determine its internal structure. Seismometry
and magnetometry will also be used to investigate the interior of the
comet.
 
The scientific objectives of the Rosetta Lander can be listed
according to their priority as follows:
1. Determination of the composition of cometary surface and
   subsurface matter: bulk elemental abundances, isotopic ratios,
   minerals, ices, carbonaceous compounds, organics, volatiles - also
   in dependence on time and insolation.
2. Investigation of the structure and physical properties of the
   cometary surface: topography, texture, roughness, regolith scales,
   mechanical, electrical, optical, and thermal properties,
   temperatures. Characterization of the near surface plasma
   environment.
3. Investigation of the global internal structure.
4. Investigation of the comet/plasma interaction.
 
The in situ measurements performed by the Rosetta Lander instruments
will also provide local ground truth to calibrate Orbiter
instruments.
 
Lander Experiments
------------------
The Rosetta-Lander is equipped with a Sample Drill &amp; Distribution
(SD2) subsystem which is in charge to collect cometary surface
samples at given depth and distribute them to the following
instruments: CIVA-M (microscope (MS) &amp; Infrared Spectrometer (IS)),
the ovens, serving COSAC and PTOLEMY.
 
Comet sample from pre-determinated and/or known (measured) depth are
collected and transported by SD2 to well defined locations:
* MS &amp; IS viewing place
* ovens for high temperature (800 deg C) heating
* ovens for medium temperature (130 deg C) heating.
* ovens with a window, where samples can be investigated by CIVA-M
 
Here a description of all the instruments of the Lander:
 
APXS: Alpha-p-X-ray spectrometer
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The goal of the Rosetta APXS experiment is the determination of the
chemical composition of the landing site and its potential alteration
during the comet&apos;s approach to the Sun. The data obtained is
used to characterize the surface of the comet, to determine the
chemical composition of the dust component, and to compare the dust
with known meteorite types.

CIVA: Panoramic and microscopic imaging system
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The Cometary Infrared and Visible Analiser (CIVA) is an integrated
set of imaging instruments, designed to characterize the landing and
sampling site, the 360 deg panorama as seen from the Rosetta Lander,
all samples collected and delivered by the Drill Sample and
Distribution System, and the stratigraphy within the boreholes. It is
constituted by a panoramic stereo camera (CIVA-P), and a microscope
coupled to an IR spectrometer (CIVA-M). CIVA is sharing a common
Imaging Main Electronics (CIVA/ROLIS/IME) with ROLIS. CIVA-P will
characterize the landing site, from the landing legs to the local
horizon. The camera is composed of 6 identical micro-cameras, mounted
of the Lander sides, with their optical axes separated by 60 deg. In
addition, stereoscopic capability is provided by one additional micro-
camera, identical to and co-aligned with one of the panoramic micro-
camera, with its optical axis 10 cm apart.
 
CIVA-M combines in separated boxes, two ultra-compact and
miniaturized channels, one visible microscope CIVA-M/V and one IR
spectrometer CIVA-M/I, to characterize, by non-destructive analyses,
the texture, albedo, mineralogical and molecular composition of each
of the samples collected and distributed by the Drill Sample and
Distribution System.

CONSERT: Radio sounding, nucleus tomography
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The Comet Nucleus Sounding Experiment by Radio wave Transmission
(CONSERT) is a complex experiment that performs tomography of the
comet nucleus revealing its internal structure. CONSERT operates as a
time domain transponder between the Lander, on the comet surface and
the Orbiter orbiting the comet. A radio signal passes from the
orbiting component of the instrument to the component on the comet
surface and is then immediately transmitted back to its source, the
idea being to establish a radio link that passes through the comet
nucleus. The varying propagation delay as the radio waves pass through
different parts of the cometary nucleus is used to determine the
dielectric properties of the nuclear material. Many properties of the
comet nucleus is examined as its overall structural homogeneity, the
average size of the sub-structures (Cometesimals) and the number and
thickness of the various layers beneath the surface.

COSAC: Evolved gas analyser - elemental and molecular composition
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The COmetary SAmpling and Composition experiment COSAC is one of the
two &apos;evolved gas analysers&apos; (EGAs) on board the Rosetta-Lander.
Whereas the other EGA, Ptolemy, aims mainly at accurately measuring
isotopic ratios of light elements, the COSAC is specialised on
detection and identification of complex organic molecules. The
instrument can be described as an effort to analyse in situ, mainly
with respect to the composition of the volatile fraction, cometary
matter nearly as well and accurately as could be done in a laboratory
on Earth. Due to the Rosetta Lander rotatability, the instrument can
conduct analyses and investigations at different spots of the landing
site and, aided by the drill, take samples for analysis from a depth
up to at least 0.2 m.

PTOLEMY: Evolved gas analyser - isotopic composition
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The size of a small shoe box and weighing less than 5 kg, Ptolemy
uses gas chromatography / mass spectrometry (GCMS) techniques to
investigate the comet surface &amp; subsurface. The instrument concept is
termed &apos;MODULUS&apos; which is taken to mean Methods Of Determining and
Understanding Light elements from Unequivocal Stable isotope
compositions. The scientific goal of the PTOLEMY is to understand the
geochemistry of light elements, such as hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen
and oxygen, by determining their nature, distribution and stable
isotopic compositions.

MUPUS: Measurements of surface and subsurface properties
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The Multi-Purpose Sensor Experiment actually consists of four parts:
1. A penetrator, approximately 40 cm long, is hammered into the
ground about 1m apart from the Lander for measuring during the
penetration process the mechanical strength of the material by means
of a depth sensor and a densitometer. The penetrator is equipped with
a series of temperature sensors and heaters for determining the
temperature as a function of depth and insolation.
2. An accelerometer and a temperature sensor accommodated in the
harpoon(s)
3. A four-channel infrared radiometer measures surface temperatures
in the vicinity of the Lander. Density of the nearsurface (down to
20cm) material is determined by measuring the absorption of
gamma-rays emitted from a radioactive isotope mounted at the tip of
the penetrator.

ROLIS: Descent &amp; Down-Looking Imaging
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The ROLIS Camera (Rosetta Lander Imaging System) delivered first
close-ups of the environment of the landing place of comet
67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko during the descent.
After landing ROLIS made high-resolved investigations to study
the structure (morphology) and mineralogy of the surface.

ROMAP: Magnetometer and plasma monitor
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The Rosetta Lander Magnetometer and Plasma Monitor ROMAP is a multi-
sensor experiment. The magnetic field is measured with a fluxgate
magnetometer. An electrostatic analyzer with integrated Faraday cup
measures ions and electrons. The local pressure is measured with
Pirani and Penning sensors. The sensors are situated on a short boom.
The deployment on the surface of a cometary nucleus demanded the
development of a special digital magnetometer of little weight and
small power requirements. For the first time a magnetic sensor is
operated from within a plasma sensor. A prototype of the
magnetometer, named SPRUTMAG, was flown on space station MIR.

SD2: Sampling, Drilling and Distribution Subsystem
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The sampling, drilling and distribution (SD2) subsystem provides
microscopes and advanced gas analysers with samples collected at
different depths below the surface of the comet. Specifically SD2 can
bore up to 250 mm into the surface of the comet and collect samples
of material at predetermined and/or known depths. It then transports
each sample to a carousel which feeds samples to different instrument
stations: a spectrometer, a volume check plug, ovens for high and
medium temperatures and a cleaning station. SD2 is accommodated
on the flat ground-plate of the Rosetta, where it is exposed to
the cometary environment.

GROUND SEGMENT
=====================================================================
 
This section summarizes the roles and responsabilities for the
Rosetta Ground Segment.
 
The primary responsibility for developing the payload operations
strategy for the Rosetta Scientific Mission is the Rosetta Science
Working Team. The Rosetta Science Working Team (SWT) monitors and
advises on all aspects of Rosetta which affect its scientific
performance.
 
Rosetta Ground Segment
-----------------------
The Rosetta ground segment consists of two major elements: the
Rosetta Mission Operations Centre (RMOC) and the Rosetta Science
Ground Segment (RSGS).
 
Rosetta Science Ground Segment
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The Rosetta Science Ground Segment (RSGS) is located at the
European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC) in Spain. The main task is to
support the Rosetta Project Scientist in the planning of the science
operations schedule and in the generation of coordinated operational
sequences, the payload command sequences for all Rosetta instruments
and their onward transmission to the Rosetta Mission Operations Centre
(RMOC). In addition, the RSGS prepares the trajectory during the comet
escort phase.
 
Rosetta Mission Operations Center
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The Rosetta Mission Operations Center (RMOC) is located at the
European Space Operations Center (ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany. The
RMOC is responsible for the Spacecraft operations and all real time
contacts with the spacecraft and payload, the overall mission
planing, flight dynamics and spacecraft and payload data
distribution.
 
Rosetta Lander Ground Segment
------------------------------
The Rosetta Lander Ground Segment (RLGS) is made up of two
operational teams. When CNES joined the DLR consortium for developing
the Lander, it was decided to divide the RLGS into 2 centers (see
Lander Project Plan [RL-PL-DLR-97002]).
These teams are responsible for the success of the Lander operations,
to ensure that the Lander performs the science with regards to its
status, and to give the data to the PI&apos;s and suppliers.
 
Lander Control Center
- - - - - - - - - - - -
The Lander Control Center (LCC), located at DLR/MUSC in Koeln
(Germany), in charge of Rosetta Lander operations during the flight
segment definition, design, realization, assembly and tests.
 
Science Operations and Navigation Center
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The Science Operations and Navigation Center is under CNES
responsibility, located in Toulouse (France). It is responsible for
the navigation and mission analysis aspects, including separation,
landing and descent strategies and generation of the scientific
sequences.
 
Rosetta Scientific Data Archive
--------------------------------
All scientific data obtained during the full mission duration
remains proprietary of the PI teams and the Lander teams for a maximum
period of 6 months after they have been received from ESOC. After
this period, the scientific data products from the mission have to be
submitted to RSOC in a reduced and calibrated form such that they can
be used by the scientific community. The Archive Scientist prepares
the release of Rosetta Scientific Data Archive after reception from
the individual Rosetta instruments and after the 6 months proprietary
period.

ROSETTA Mission Overview
=====================================================================
 
The ROSETTA mission is an interplanetary mission whose main
objectives are the rendezvous and in-situ measurements of the comet
67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, scheduled for 2014/2015. The spacecraft
carries a Rosetta Lander, named Philae, to the nucleus and deploys it
onto its surface.
 
A brief description of the mission and its objectives can be found in
[GLASSMEIERETAL2007A]. A detailed description of the mission analysis
can be found in the ROSETTA User Manual [RO-DSS-MA-1001], and the
flight Operations Plan [RO-ESC-PL-5000].
 
On its long way to the comet nucleus after a Launch by Ariane 5 P1+
in March 2004, the ROSETTA spacecraft orbited the Sun for one year
until it returned to Earth for the first swing-by. The planet Mars was
reached in February 2007, about 3 years after launch. In November
2007 a second Earth swing-by took place and a third one in November
2009. Two asteroid flybys (2867 Steins and 21 Lutetia) were performed
on the way to the comet. These two asteroids had been selected at the
Science Working Team meeting on 11th March 2004 among all the
available candidate asteroids, depending on the scientific interest
and the propellant required for the correction manoeuvre. Around the
aphelion of its orbit, which is 5.3 AU from the Sun, the spacecraft
has been in a spinning hibernation mode for about 2.5 years.
 
Rosetta rendezvoused with comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in August
2014. The Philae lander was deployed to the surface of the comet on 12
November 2014.
The end of the nominal mission is planned in December 2015.
 
Please note:
------------
The ROSETTA spacecraft was originally designed for a mission to the
comet 46 P/Wirtanen to be launched in January 2003. Due to a delay of
the launch a new comet (67P/Churyumow-Gerasimenko) had been selected
by the Science Working Team on 3rd-4th April 2003.
The compliance of the design was checked and where necessary adapted
for this new mission. Therefore in the following all the details and
characteristics for this new mission are used.
 
 
ROSETTA Mission Objectives
=====================================================================
 
The scientific objectives of the ROSETTA mission can be considered
from three main viewpoints:
 
First of all, comets and asteroids are fully-fledged members of our
solar system, which means, that they are objects of intrinsic
interest to planetary scientists. The level of investigations
conducted on these bodies is therefore far below that achieved for
the other objects of the solar system.
The study of the small solar-system bodies arguably represents the
last major gap in the tremendous worldwide effort that has been made
to reveal our planetary neighbours to us.
 
The most important scientific rationale for studying small solar-
system bodies is the key role-play in helping us to understand the
formation of the solar system. Comets and asteroids have a close
genetic relationship with the planetesimals, which formed from the
solar nebula 4.57 billion years ago. Most of our present
understanding of these processes has been obtained by studying
meteorites, which constitute a biased sample of asteroidal material,
and micrometeoroids, which may represent cometary grains processed by
solar radiation and atmospheric entry. There is therefore a strong
scientific case of studying cometary material in situ, as it is
surely more primitive than extraterrestrial samples.
 
A third scientific aspect is the study of the physio-chemical
processes, which are specific to comets and asteroids. In this
respect, asteroids can provide information on impact phenomena,
particularly on very large scale. However, the increase in cometary
activity as these bodies approach the Sun undoubtedly represents one
of the most complex and fascinating processes to be observed in the
solar system.
 
Science Objectives
---------------------
The prime scientific objectives as defined in the Announcement of
Opportunity [RO-EST-AO-0001] by the Rosetta Science Team can be
summarized as:
 
- Global characterisation of the nucleus, determination of dynamic
properties, surface morphology and composition
 
- Chemical, mineralogical and isotropic compositions of volatiles and
refractories in a cometary nucleus
 
- Physical properties and interrelation of volatiles and refractories
in a cometary nucleus
 
- Study of the development of cometary activity and the processes in
the surface layer of the nucleus and in the inner coma (dust-gas
interaction)
 
- Origin of comets, relationship between cometary and interstellar
material.
 
- Implications for the origin of the solar system
 
- Global characterisation of the asteroid, determination of dynamic
properties, surface morphology and composition.
 
 
Mission Profile
=====================================================================
 
The ROSETTA mission profile results from the orbit of the target
comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, which has a perihelion close to 1.2
AU and an aphelion of about 5.7 AU, resulting in a period of about
6.5 years. A detailed description of the Mission Profile can be found
in the Rosetta Mission Calendar [RO-ESC-PL-5026] and in the RSOC
Design Specification [RO-EST-PL-2010].
 
The injection of the spacecraft by a single Ariane 5 Launch with the
so-called &apos;delayed ignition&apos; of the upper stage, was not directly into
the trajectory to the comet, because of the high spacecraft wet mass.
Therefore the spacecraft had to be accelerated by a sequence of
gravity assist manoeuvres at Mars and the Earth, in order to catch up
with the comet&apos;s velocity at perihelion.
 
The initially large distance to the comet at the perihelion of its
trajectory has been slowly decreasing after the third Earth swing-by.
At the intersection of both orbits, the difference in orbit
inclination and the residual relative velocity were diminished by the
comet orbit matching manoeuvre at around 4.0 AU Sun distance. The
range of the spacecraft-to-Sun distance was between 0.88 and 5.33 AU,
defined by the minimum Sun distance during the first five years of the
mission with the swing-bys at Earth, and the maximum Sun distance
close to the aphelion of the comet&apos;s orbit. The evolution of the
spacecraft distance to Earth over the mission time followed the
profile of the Sun distance superimposed by an oscillation with an
amplitude of 2 AU (+1,-1) and a period of about one year due to the
Earth&apos;s motion around the Sun. This resulted in a range from 0 AU
(Earth Departure and Swing-by) to 6.3 AU during the superior solar
conjunction close to the spacecraft&apos;s aphelion (see Solar Conjunctions
section below).
 
After the second and third Earth swing-by ROSETTA crossed the
asteroid main belt, which gave the opportunity of two asteroid flybys.
The asteroids 2867 Steins and 21 Lutetia, were encountered on
5 September 2008 and 10 July 2010 respectively. These two asteroids
had been selected at the Science Working Team meeting on 11th March
2004 among all the available candidate asteroids, depending on the
scientific interests and the propellant required for the correction
manoeuvre.
Between the major mission events, up to the comet rendezvous
manoeuvre, the spacecraft performed long interplanetary cruise phases
(up to 2.5 years) with several solar conjunctions (see Solar
Conjunctions section below) and the power critical aphelion passage
(last cruise phase). In order to reduce the ground segment costs and
the wear and tear of spacecraft equipment during these phases, the
spacecraft was put in &apos;Hibernation Mode&apos;.
 
Two types of hibernation modes were planned to be used:
 
* &apos;Deep Space Hibernation Mode&apos; above 4.5 AU: Inertial spin mode with
a spin rate of 4 deg/sec. The spacecraft was almost entirely passive,
except of receivers/ decoders, power supply, heaters and two
Processor Modules with one RTU.
 
* &apos;Near Sun Hibernation Mode&apos; below 4.5 AU: 3-axes stabilised mode
with the solar arrays Sun-pointing and the +X-axis Earth-pointing.
Attitude control was performed with thrusters and star trackers, based
on ephemerides; occasional solar array adjustments and ground
contacts via the medium gain antenna (MGA).
 
The final approach to the comet into its sphere of influence was
prepared by the rendezvous manoeuvre (RVM-2), that matched the
spacecraft orbit with the comet orbit.
 
A subsequent sequence of approach manoeuvres, supported by optical
navigation, took the spacecraft closer and closer to the comet.
After determination of the physical model of the comet by Doppler and
optical measurements, the spacecraft was inserted into a global
mapping orbit around the comet.
 
The &apos;Duck-shape&apos; of the comet was a surprised and a challenge for the
Flight Dynamics team. Three activity cases had been planned to orbit
the comet, respectively at 30, 20 or 10km. Finally, it has been chosen
to go to 10km.
Meanwhile, a board was selecting 5 and then 2 landing sites. The
chosen landing site were located on the &apos;head&apos; of the Duck Shape
comet.
The delivery of the Lander or Surface Science Package (SSP) was
achieved from an eccentric orbit, which took the spacecraft to a low
altitude above the selected landing site. The Lander release was fully
automatic according to a predefined schedule, and led to a first touch
down with minimum vertical and horizontal velocities relative to the
local rotating surface.
The first touch down reached the foreseen landing site within 50m
accuracy. However, the Lander did not succeed in harpooning and
bounced twice. It was stopped by cliff walls, which unluckily hid the
Lander from the Sun.
The Lander, Philae, had the time to operate all instruments on board,
during a phase named the FSS, First Science Sequence, before going to
sleep on November, 15th at 00:36 UTC. Upon the landing of the Lander,
the spacecraft provided uplink and downlink data relay between the
Lander and the Earth.
 
After the Lander delivery the ROSETTA spacecraft escorted the comet
until the perihelion passage and outwards again, until a Sun distance
of 2 AU was reached at end of the year 2015. The main scientific
objective during this phase was the monitoring of the features of the
active comet.

Payload Checkouts
-----------------
Payload checkouts were scenarios designed to allow Rosetta payload to
make regular health checks, to activate mechanisms and to monitor
trends through calibration tests. They were allocated in the mission
calendar at regular 6-month periods during the first 10 years of the
mission cruise phase. They were split into passive and active payload
checkouts. Passive payload checkouts were entirely non-interactive.
Conditions for the passive checkout were that it would:
a) not require any real time monitoring, b) run entirely off of MTL,
c) not require s/c specific pointing other than to maintain listed
constraints, d) produce minimal science data. Active payload checkout
operations were executed both interactively and non-interactively .
Conditions for the active checkout were that it would: a) limit the
requirement for real time monitoring, b) run mostly from MTL, c) limit
the requirement for s/c specific pointing beyond maintaining listed
constraints, d) produce minimal science data. There was more
flexibility during active checkouts and in addition payloads used
interactive passes to make any necessary memory patches and tests.

Solar Conjunctions/Oppositions
-------------------------------
Other mission phases, which resulted from the orbit geometry and
interfered with the above operational phases, were the solar
conjunctions.
Two types of conjunctions occurred throughout the mission:
 
* Solar Oppositions: The Earth was between spacecraft and Sun,
resulting in a degradation of the command link to the spacecraft.
 
* Superior Solar Conjunctions: Sun was between spacecraft and Earth,
resulting in a degradation of the command and telemetry link to/from
the spacecraft.
 
Table below shows the solar conjunction phases throughout the mission
with type, begin and duration of the conjunction and correspondant
mission phase. The phases are defined as the periods, during which
the Sun-SpaceCraft-Earth (SSCE) angle is below 5 degrees.

It can be noted that for archive purpose and because of the non
expected landing, which included rebounds, the Lander team provided
the data sets from wake up up to the First Science Sequence (FSS) in 5
data sets with sub mission phases that differ from the official ones.

data from wake-up to FSS.
 
Mission Phases Description
=====================================================================
 
Launch and Early Orbit Phase (LEOP)
-----------------------------
Rosetta was launched by an Ariane 5/G+ in a dedicated flight (single
launch configuration) from Kourou at 07:17:51 UTC 2 March 2004. After
burnout of the lower composite, the upper stage together with the
spacecraft remained in an eccentric coast arc for nearly 2 hours.
Then the upper stage performed delayed ignition and injected the
Rosetta spacecraft into the required escape hyperbola.
 
After spacecraft separation from the upper stage, Rosetta acquired
its three axes stabilised Sun pointing attitude and deployed the solar
arrays autonomously. Ground operations acquired the down-link in
S-band using the ESA network and controlled the spacecraft to a fine-
pointing attitude with the HGA pointing towards Earth using X-band
telemetry. Tracking and orbit determination were performed, the
departure trajectory was verified and corrected by the on-board
propulsion system of the spacecraft.
 
The launch locks of the Lander Philae were released at the end of the
first ground station pass. Philae remained firmly attached to the
spacecraft by the cruise latches until its release at the comet.
 
Commissioning phase (1 and 2)
-------------------
Commissioning started three days after launch following the first
trajectory correction manoeuvre. A Deep Space Manouver (DSM1) of 173
m/s was executed at perihelion. All spacecraft functions needed during
the cruise to the comet, in particular for hibernation, were checked
and the scientific payload was commissioned.
 
Commissioning was done in two parts, as the New Norcia ground station
must have been shared with Mars Express and could not be used
by Rosetta from June to mid-September 2004.

[RO-EST-RP-3343] Interference Scenario Report
 
Cruise phase 1
--------------
Almost all the scientific instruments, except ALICE were switched off
while ground contact was practically not available. No payload
operations were done during this phase.
 
Earth swing-by 1
----------------
The actual Earth swing-by took place on 4-Mar-05. The phase ended one
month after the swing-by and the spacecraft was prepared for the next
cruise phase to Mars.
One passive Payload Checkout was scheduled end of March 2005.
Immediately after this flyby an Asteroid Flyby Mode Simulation was
performed using the Moon as a target. Some limited payload operations
were permitted shortly before during and shortly after this Earth
Flyby. Rosetta payload teams were given the opportunity to conduct
scientific investigation that included close approach of both the
Earth and the Moon and the AFM simulation. Any activities that did not
require the Earth-Moon system i.e. continued instrument commissioning,
were considered for later in the Mission, such as during the next
active checkout.
 
The instrument objectives are listed below.
 
ORBITER
 
  ALICE
    - Flat field calibration
    - Extended object scattered light calibration (Moon as the target)
    - Absolute solar calibration
    - Absolute flux and wavelength calibration (wide part of the slit
    to take in the Moon)
    - Door performance test due to anomalies raised during
    commissioning
 
  MIRO
    - Asteroid Flyby Simulation test
    - H2O lines in Earth (high quality data obtained but analysis not
    complete)
    - Radiometric calibration of the Moon

    - Magnetospheric physics
    - Verification of the science operations modes for the Mars flyby
 
  RSI
    - HGA to Earth around closest approach to Moon

    - Because of technical issues OSIRIS was not operated during the
    Earth Swing-By itself.
 
 
  VIRTIS
    - Co-alignment M/H
    - Aldebaran target in IR (failed, boresight did not detect the
    target)
    - Absolute calibration using the Moon
    - Full disc Earth imaging including exosphere over one rotation
 
LANDER
 
  CIVA
    - Earth Picture with Camera #2 or 4
 
  ROMAP with RPC MAG
    - magnetic axes alignment of sensors with Earth magnetic field
    - Checking of scaled values with known Earth values
    - Solar wind values comparison with other s/c
 
 
Problems:
 
  RPC
    - Loss of LAP science data for 41.5 hours (2005-03-01 19:00 --
    2005-04-03 12:30).

Cruise phase 2 (and Deep Impact)
--------------------------------
After leaving the Earth, the spacecraft made one revolution around the
Sun, and in the second arc from perihelion to aphelion made a swing-by
of Mars.
 
There was a solar conjunction for more than one month in April 2006
(see Solar Conjunctions section above). Two passive check-outs with
non-interactive instrument operations for about 5 days were scheduled
during the cruise to Mars. PC1 occured from 5/09/2005 to 5/10/2005.
PC2 took place from 3/03/2006 to 8/03/2006.
 
The NASA Deep Impact mission encountered comet 9P/Tempel 1 on 4 July
2005, which fell into the Cruise 2 mission phase. At around 06:00
UTC, the mother probe sent a 362 kg impactor into the nucleus with a
relative speed of 10.2 km/s. Rosetta was in a privileged position for
its remote sensing instruments to observe the event (80 million km
distance, 90 degrees angle respect to the sun). Rosetta monitored
Tempel 1 continuously (i.e. 24 hrs per day) over an extended period
from 7 days before the deep impact to 11 days afterwards (27Jun-15Jul
2005). The first 2 days ALICE observed the stars for calibration. From
the 28th June to the 15th July, OSIRIS, ALICE, and MIRO operated
observing comet 9P/Tempel 1 continuously. VIRTIS was on only several
hours around the impact. Maintenance activities were carried out for
COSIMA, ROSINA, ALICE.
 
During the Deep Impact subphase, the instruments had the following
objectives:
 
ORBITER
 
  ALICE
    - Baseline pre-impact spectrum. Comparison with near and long
    term post impact spectra. The comet was detected in all spectra.
    - Strong atomic lines of neutral H and O were detected throughout
    the observation period.
    - Two weak lines of neutral C detected on some dates. No change
    detected by ALICE in comet&apos;s UV spectrum as a result of impact
    - except for possible enhancement in C emission.
    - No evidence of Ar, S, N, CO.
    - Water production rates. Results TBC.
    - Dark histograms.
    - Calibration star before the encounter. Spectra of calibration
    star was used for calibration of the Deep Impact spectra and
    instrument sensitivity. The data was also used to look for any
    flux variations due to pointing/jitter (initial results did not
    show any evidence of significant fluctuations in the stellar
    count rate).
    - Memory patch (time synchronisation issue).
 
  MIRO
    - Changes in the coma composition induced by the impact.
    - Upper limit on the water production rate in the pre-impact
    phase of the experiment. Water production rate and albeit
    with low signal-to-noise measured in the post impact phase. The
    water production rate was less than had been anticipated based
    on models.
    - Detection of carbon monoxide: the analysis was not complete but
    so far no CO was detected.
    - Estimate of Doppler velocity.
 
  OSIRIS
    - Accurate photometry of the unresolved nucleus (no atmosphere in
    between) with complete time coverage. The time resolution was
    better than a minute around the impact and could draw conclusion
    about the evolution of the impact cloud during the first hour.
    The long term monitoring allowed determination of the composition
    and evolution of the impact cloud (water production and dust/ice
    ratio)
    - UV coverage that allowed imaging of the OH emission at 308nm
    (estimate of the water production by the impact)
    - Imaging of the coma out to at least 150000km from the nucleus.
    The effect of the impact could be seen in the images for
    appromximately a week (stereo reconstruction of coma,
    impact cloud).
 
  VIRTIS
    - Coma and ejecta composition and temporal evolution. But the
    outburst due to the impact was not energetic enough to reach the
    minimum sensitivity required.
 
Conclusions of the Deep Impact Observations:
 
The science objectives of the Deep Impact Observations scenario were
met. The brightness increase of Tempel 1 produced by the impact was
lower than we had hoped for, and as a result the comet was too weak to
be detected by VIRTIS. For ALICE and MIRO the signal was just above
the sensitivity limit, but nevertheless important measurements could
be achieved. The results of OSIRIS even exceeded the expectations, and
the first scientific publications were widely cited. The data
collected by the experiments on board Rosetta are unique because
Tempel 1 was monitored continuously over an extended period of time
(no day-and-night cycle in contrast to ground-based telescopes) and in
the absence of an absorbing atmosphere.
 
The following operations was done during the Passive checkout 1:
 
ORBITER
 
  ALICE
    - Electronic and software
    - Test pattern and stim test
    - Memory check
    - dark exposures
    There was no instrument anomalies. The door performance test
    showed nominal behavior.
 
  CONSERT
    - Consert Orbiter verification
    - Consert Lander verification
    - Consert Orbiter/Lander time synchronisation
 
  COSIMA
    - Self check
    - Target manipulator unit maintenance
    - Ion emitter maintenance
 
  GIADA
    - Run mechanisms - cover operations
    - Health check (all subsystems, electronics, noise and
    contamination monitoring, performances estimation)
 
  MIDAS
    - Exercising of all mechanisms (shutter, approach mechanism,
    linear stage, wheel, scanner)
    The test was successful and MIDAS is fully operable.
 
  MIRO
    - Regular exercise and health check of all commands in all modes
    - Regular dump of EEPROM memory to check for radiation damage.
    All objectives were met. There was no radiation damage of the
    EEPROM.
 
  RPC
    - MAG: instrument calibration. Undisturbed solar wind was measured
    to calibrate the offsets of the MAG instrument in quiet conditions
    (Hedgecock method).
    - LAP: instrument calibration.
    - MIP: Instrument checkout
    - IES: measurement in the undisturbed solar wind for calibration
    of its sensors and cross calibration with LAP.
    The PC operations were completed successfully with no change in
    instrument performance for MAG and IES.
 
  RSI
    Two frequency downlink driven by the USO and a ground station
    that could receive the X and S band signals.
    - Investigate the stability of the USO
    - Verify interaction with the ground
    Investigations of the USO data from PC#0 revealed that the
    behaviour of the USO was obviously not as good as it had been
    during the last USO test in October.
 
  OSIRIS
    - Exercise the instrument mechanisms
    - Verify the sanity of the CCD
    - Verify the focus
    No anomaly occurred.
 
 
LANDER
  Test of the Lander Platform overall performance
  Secondary battery monitoring
  Lander extended AFT
  CDMS EEPROM dump
  functional test for
    PTOLEMY
    CONSERT
 
The following operations have been done during the Passive checkout 2:
 
ORBITER
 
  ALICE
    - same health tests as PC1. Tests successful.
 
  CONSERT
    - same as PC1. Tests generally successful (see report)
 
  COSIMA
    - self check of all hardware sub-systems on operational voltage
    levels
    - target manipulator unit checkout
    - maintenance COSISCOPE checkout
    - emitter maintenance
    Tests generally successful.
 
  GIADA
    - Same as PC1 plus monitoring of MBS coating evolution.
    The cover operations went fine. There was no further contamination
    of the microbalances. GDS is not fully tested for light
    conditions. IS seems nominal. All HK values were as expected.
 
  MIDAS
    - same as PC1. Tests were successful.
 
  MIRO
    - Same as PC1. Overall success.
 
  RPC
    - Same as PC1. All performances checked were nominal.
 
  RSI
    - Same as PC1. The USO behaved very good, USO drift satisfactory.
 
  OSIRIS
    - Same as PC1. Generally successful. For solar elongation
    angles &lt; 90 degrees OSIRIS got substantial scattered light
    through the nominally closed doors. The scattered light observed
    during PC2 was unfortunately enough that parts of the CCD surface
    was saturated. This happened in spite of the large exposure time
    reduction that was made after PC1.
 
  VIRTIS
    - The check done were performed properly.
 
LANDER
  Same as PC1 plus functional tests for
    MUPUS
    CONSERT

Mars swing-by
-------------
The mission phase began two months before DSM2 of 65 m/s, which was
performed near perihelion. The actual Mars swing-by took place on
25-Feb-07. The minimum altitude with respect to the Martian surface
was 200 km. The relative approach and departure velocity was 8.8 km/s.
During the swing-by a communications black-out of approximately 14
min was expected due to occultation of the spacecraft by Mars.
Furthermore the spacecraft was expected to be in eclipse for about 24
min. The phase ended one month after DSM3. DSM3 of 129 m/s was
scheduled near the aphelion of this arc in order to obtain the proper
arrival conditions at the Earth. Two passive payload check-outs of
about 5 days and an active longer one of 25 days were scheduled during
the phase (PC3, PC4, PC5).
 
PC3 started on 25th August 2006 and ended 30th August 2006.
The following operations were planed during PC3. GIADA and ROSINA did
not take part in this PC.
 
ORBITER
  ALICE
    - Electronics &amp; software verification, test pattern and stim test,
    Memory Check, Aperture Door, Performance Test.
    All operations are executed as expected.
 
  CONSERT
    - Consert Orbiter verification, Consert Lander verification,
    Consert Orbiter/Lander time Synchronisation.
 
  COSIMA
    - self check of all hardware sub-systems on operational voltage
    levels, target manipulator unit checkout and maintenance emitter
    maintenance
 
  MIDAS
    - Regular health check and exercising of all mechanisms (shutter,
    approach mechanism, linear stage, wheel, scanner)
 
  MIRO
    - Regular exercise and health check of all commands in all modes.
    Regular dump of EEPROM memory to check for radiation damage.
    All operations are successful.
 
  RPC
    - MAG: Instrument calibration. Undisturbed solar wind measurement.
    Such data will be used to calibrate the offsets of the MAG
    instrument in quiet conditions (Hedgecock method).
    - LAP: Instrument calibration.
    - MIP: Instrument checkout.
    - IES: measurements in the undisturbed solar wind for calibration
    of its sensors and crosscalibration with LAP.
 
  RSI
    - Investigate the stability of the USO and verify interaction
    with the ground.
    The PC3 results were very promising and the behavior of the USO
    is as good as expected. The stability of the USO was still one
    order of magnitude better than anticipated before launch.
 
  OSIRIS
    - Instrument mechanisms, verify the sanity of the CCD, verify the
    focus of the instrument.
 
  VIRTIS
    - Both VIRTIS M and H were working as expected.
    - PC3 was used to verify the upload of a new pixel map for
    VIRTIS-H to be used during the forthcoming PC4 (pixel map allowed
    to drastically reduce the data volume).
 
LANDER
  - Test of the Lander platform to check the overall performance and
  Secondary Battery Status
  - Lander Extended AFT with short function
  - tests of some units and
  EEPROM
  - checks for all ComDPU units
  - Secondary Battery Monitoring
  - CDMS EEPROM dump
  - Separate short functional tests for MUPUS and CONSERT
 
PC4 was an active checkout. It started on Nov., 23rd and ended on

Although several open issues were resolved in this checkout, several
issues remain open and new anomaly report were generated.
75% of the planned operations were successful. The 25% loss was mainly
due to OSIRIS that lost the majority of its operations.
 
PC5 is a Passive Check Out that started on May, 18th and ended on May,
23rd 2007. The instruments that took part in this PC are listed below:
ALICE, CONSERT, COSIMA, GIADA, LANDER, MIDAS, MIRO, RPC, RSI, OSIRIS.
VIRTIS was NOGO and did not operate.
Main objectives of the scenario have been met with no issues.

Cruise phase 3
--------------
No check-outs were scheduled during the short cruise to Earth.
 
Earth swing-by 2
----------------
Daily operations started again around two months before Rosetta
reached Earth with tracking and navigation manoeuvres. The actual
Earth swing-by took place on 13-Nov-07. The perigee altitude was
13890 km. The relative approach and departure velocity was 9.3 km/s.
The phase ended one month after the LGA strobing phase. In this phase
the spacecraft got very close to the sun (min distance 0.91AU). One 15
day payload checkout and one 5 day payload checkout were also
scheduled in this phase (PC6 and PC7).
 
Payload Checkout 6 (PC6) was an active checkout where a target
independent opportunity to perform interactive operations and to
request spacecraft pointing was given to all Rosetta payload teams.
The active payload checkout 6 ran for 15 consecutive days starting on
the 13th September 2007 until the 29th September 2006.
All Rosetta payload took part in this scenario. Operations ranged from
a repeat of established passive checkout operations to extensive
software patching and calibration campaigns. Four instruments required
active spacecraft pointing during the scenario with nine different
targets observed. Pointing types were 7 stares, 2 slew scans, 2 raster
scans giving a total of around 176 hours of dedicated spacecraft
pointing. These were mostly for calibration purposes.
Overall operations went smoothly. Although several open issues were
resolved in this checkout several issues remained open and new ones
have been generated.
 
Payload Checkout 7 (PC7) was a passive checkout run form 4th January
2008 to 9th January 2008. Main objectives have been met with no issue
apart from GD. This issue was due to higher operating temperatures
resulting from the short Sun-Spacecraft distance.

Cruise phase 4 (split into 4-1 and 4-2)
--------------
In this phase the spacecraft made one revolution around the Sun.
A solar conjunction took place in January 2009 (see Solar Conjunctions
section above), together with another two conjunctions of the Earth-
spacecraft- Sun angle (Sun-Earth conjunction as seen from the
spacecraft). In this phase the spacecraft got very close to the sun
(min distance 0.91AU). This Cruise phase has been splitted in two
parts after the selection of the first Asteroid flyby which fell
in the middle of this phase. Cruise 4-1 was before the flyby phase,
and 4-2 was right after. Two passive check-outs were scheduled, one
during Cruise 4-1 and the second one during Cruise 4-2.
 
During CR4, Passive Checkout 9 and Active Checkout 8 were planned.
 
Payload Checkout 8 (PC8) was an active checkout where a target
independent opportunity to perform interactive operations and to
request spacecraft pointing was given to all Rosetta payload teams.
All Rosetta payload took part in this scenario.
The Active Payload Checkout 8 ran for 2 days (05-06 July 2008) plus 26
consecutive days starting on the 9th July 2008 until the 1st August
2008.
Three instruments required active spacecraft pointing during the
scenario with 9 different targets observed. Pointing types were 14
stares and 3 raster scans. These were mostly for calibration purposes.
 
Payload Checkout 9(PC9) was a passive checkout executed between 28th
January and 2nd February 2009. An RSI passive checkout was also
completed on 09th February. All but 2 of the Rosetta payload
instruments participated in the scenario, the exceptions being Rosina
and Virtis. Operations were limited to instrument health checks and
passive checkouts, as is the case for nominal Passive Checkout
scenarios. All of the operations planned and executed in the PC09
scenario were successful (as detailed in Section 3). Minor issues were
observed by 2 instruments (CN and RS) but none of these prevented the
successful completion of the corresponding operations.

Steins flyby
-------------
Asteroid Steins was the first dedicated scientific target of the
Rosetta mission. Closest approach was on 5 September 2008 at 18:38:22
UTC. Rosetta flew at 800 km from asteroid Steins. For the first time a
European spacecraft flew next to an asteroid, performed an optical
navigation campaign, and autonomously tracked the asteroid by means of
its on board camera.
 
The 2867 Steins E-type asteroid had been discovered on 4 November 1969
by N. Chernykh. Its dimensions have been estimated by [KELLERETAL2010]
to 6.67 x 5.81 x 4.47 km3, corresponding to a spherical equivalent
radius of 2.65 km. Its sideral rotation period has been estimated to
6.04681 +/- 0.00002h, its pole direction in ecliptic coordinates to
approximately Lambda = 250 deg and Beta = -89 deg with an error of
about 5 degrees [LAMYETAL2008]. Its albedo has been estimated to 0.3
in the visible and 0.4 in the infrared, both by [KELLERETAL2010] and
[LAMYETAL2008].
 
The two asteroids Rosetta flew by are secondary science targets of the
Rosetta mission, with comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko being the
primary science target. Therefore, scientific measurements of Asteroid
(2867) Steins had highest priority. Some calibrations were also
performed during the flyby phase.
 
The flyby geometry necessitated a flip in the spacecraft attitude
before closest approach. As a compromise between the incompatible
requirements to minimize the illumination of the -X and +-Y panels of
the spacecraft (flip as late as possible) and to minimize the impact
on the science observations (flip as early as possible), the
spacecraft flip was performed between 40 and 20 minutes before closest
approach. Rosetta&apos;s relative speed with respect to Steins was 8.6km/s.
 
The heliocentric and geocentric distances of Rosetta during the Steins
flyby were 2.14 AU and 2.41 AU, respectively. The one way light travel
time was 20 minutes.
 
The estimated accuracy of the determination of the position of Steins
in the plane perpendicular to the flight direction during the naviga-
-tion campaign was +/-2 kms for navigation with OSIRIS and +/-16 kms
for navigation with the NAVCAMs (from navigation slot on Sept. 4). For
the targeted passage through phase angle 0 at a distance of 1280 kms
from Steins, a positional offset of 2 kms would correspond to a
minimum phase angle of 0.1 degree.

The Rosetta first asteroid flyby was a success. The navigation
campaign produced highly accurate predictions of the Steins position,
and during the flyby most instruments worked without serious problems.
Asteroid flyby mode worked well, although with somewhat lower tracking
accuracy than expected.
 
Summary results per instrument during closest approach can be found in
the operation report:
[RO-SGS-RP-0020] Science Operations Report for the Steins FlyBy
 
Earth swing-by 3
----------------
Operations were essentially the same as for the Earth swing-by 2. The
actual Earth swing-by took place in Nov-09. The perigee altitude was
300 km. The relative approach and departure velocity was 9.9 km/s.
Phase started 3 months before the swing-by and ends 1 month later. Two
short payload checkouts of about 5 days each were scheduled during
this phase.
 
The phase contained the Active Payload Checkout 10 (PC10). The section
first describes PC 10 and then the Earth Flyby.
 
  PC10
  ----
  The Active PC10 ran for 18 consecutive days from 18th September 2009
  to 4th October 2009. It represented a target independent opportunity
  to perform interactive operations and to request spacecraft
  pointing. All payloads took part in this scenario, as interactive
  or non-interactive operations. There were approximately 425 hours of
  non-interactive and 68 hours of interactive operations. Four
  instruments required active s/c pointing with 15 targets observed
  (111 hours of dedicated s/c pointing). These were mostly for
  calibration purposes.
 
  More details on the results can be found in the report:
[RO-SGS-RP-0022] Payload Report Active PC10
 
  Earth flyby 3 (EAR3)
  --------------
  This was the last of the three gravity assists from the Earth, after
  which Rosetta increased its orbital energy, enough to allow the
  scheduled encounter with the asteroid 21-Lutetia and the rendezvous
  with Churyumov-Gerasimenko. From an operational point of view, the
  swing-by spacecraft operations were of highest priority, and both
  science observations and payload operations were only allowed on a
  non-interference basis with those. Keeping this in mind, Rosetta had
  the opportunity to perform special scientific observations of the
  Earth-Moon system, instrument calibrations using Earth and/or Moon
  and public relations observations.
 
  The criticality of the spacecraft operations left payload operations
  in a second place, provided that Earth is not a scientific target
  for Rosetta and that potential trajectory correction manoeuvres
  would force the cancellation of all of them. This is reflected in
  the fact that only six instruments took part in the operations:
  ALICE, MIRO, OSIRIS, RPC, VIRTIS and SREM.
  Operation scheduling was centred on Earth Closest Approach,
  which took place on 13 Nov. 2009 at 07:45:40 UTC, and overall
  operations went smoothly, despite some scattered events.
  According to the available reports, the EAR3 can be considered as
  fully successful.
 
EAR3 results are described in [RO-SGS-RP-0023].
 
Cruise phase 5
--------------
One Active checkout (12) was scheduled during this cruise phase.
It can be noted that Passive Checkout 11 were cancelled since there
was not enough time to include it between PC10 and PC12. PC 11 was
supposed to be passive meaning that it is mainly instrument
health check operations. PC 10 and 12 are active and more important to
preserve.
 
Payload Checkout 12 (PC12) was an active checkout that ran for 23
consecutive days starting on the 22nd April 2010 until the 14th May
2010. All Rosetta payload took part in this scenario. Operations
ranged from a repeat of established passive checkout operations to
extensive software patching and calibration campaigns.
Overall operations went smoothly. Numerous open issues were resolved
in this checkout, whilst several issues remain open and new ones have
been generated. There was a particularly noticeable and positive
increase in the success rate of payload operations, when compared to
previous Scenarios.
 
All results can be read in [RO-SGS-RP-0027] report.
 
Lutetia Flyby  (17/05/2010 - 03/09/2010)
--------------
The second of the flybys took place on 10 July 2010 to the asteroid
21 Lutetia, discovered on 15 November 1852 by H. Goldschmidt. Its
classification into a specific asteroid type had turned out to be
ambiguous and included the possibilities of a C-type or an M-type
asteroid. This contradiction made it an interesting object for close
inspection.
Closest Approach (CA) occurred at 15:45 UT at a distance of 3168.2km.
The relative fly-by velocity was of 15 km/s. The fly-by strategy
allowed continuous observations of Lutetia before, during and for 30
minutes after CA.
Images obtained by OSIRIS revealed that Lutetia has a complex geology
and one of the highest asteroid densities measured so far,
3.4+/-0.3g/cm3. Its geologically complex surface, ancient surface age
and high density suggest that Lutetia is most likely a primordial
planetesimal.
This is the second of the two asteroids selected at the Science
Working Team meeting on 11th March 2004 among all the available
candidate asteroids, depending on the scientific interests and the
propellant required for the correction manoeuvre.
 
The following operations took place around the Lutetia fly-by:
21 May 2010 - 9 July 2010: Navigation campaign (astrometry) using the
OSIRIS NAC and NAVCAM.
5 July 2010- 14 July 2010: scientific operations targeting the
asteroid.
The Lutetia fly-by was a success. The navigation campaign produced
highly accurate predictions of the position of Lutetia and during
the fly-by most instruments worked without serious problems (except
Rosina, RPC IES and RPC ICA). Asteroid fly-by mode worked excellently.
The objectives summarised below have been addressed by the instrument
measurements:
  - Physical and thermal properties, mineralogy and geomorphology of
    Lutetia from spatially resolved multi-wavelengths remote-sensing
    observations between the extreme UV and the mm-range.
  - Determination of the mass of the asteroid from Doppler
    measurements of the spacecraft trajectory.
  - Global shape parameters from light curves taken days before CA.
  - Search for satellite/dust particles.
  - Search for an asteroid magnetic field.
  - Particle and field measurements.
 
Results of the Lutetia Fly By can be found in [RO-SGS-RP-0028].
 
Rendez-Vous Manouver 1   (04/09/2010 - 13/07/2011)
----------------------
The deep space manoeuvre was carried out when the spacecraft reached
a distance from the Sun around 4.5 AU on 23-Jan-11. One passive check
-out (13) was scheduled during this phase. One solar conjunction of
50 days and one solar opposition of 37 days happened during this
phase.(see Solar Conjunctions section above).
 
--PC 13 (1st-9th Dec 2010 + 14th Dec)
This was the final Cruise Phase Checkout. A number of additional
payload operations were also executed, to close out pending and
essential requirements, and/or to configure instruments for the
upcoming Deep Space Hibernation Phase. Only OSIRIS did not participate
in PC 13. PC13 ran for 9 consecutive days between 1st and 9th December
2010. A RSI passive checkout was also completed on 14th December.
All of the operations planned and executed were successful. Minor
issues were observed by 4 instruments (Consert, Philae, Rosina, RPC).
Alice performed succesfully some instrument checkout.
Cosima did periodical maintenance and check its status.
Giada checked successfully its status.
Midas performed a normal passive check-out and an additional modified
one for Deep Space Hibernation Preparation.
Miro performed a normal and sucessful passive check-out.
Osiris did not participate in the PC13 timeframe. However, on 23-26th
March 2011 - post RVM1 - specific OSIRIS operations were performed in
order to prepare and configure the instrument for the Rosetta Deep
Space Hibernation.
The Lander performed some operations and Consert performed an unit
functional test; both were partially successful.
Rosina did not participate in the nominal PC13 scenario, but conducted
several specific operations immediately following completion of the
nominal PC13 timeline. A spacecraft slew was executed with RTOF
monitoring, to further investigate data observed during Lutetia
fly-by.
RPC PIU, IES, LAP, ICA performed checkout with some errors/anomalies
reported, which were considered as no problem for the instrument.
Virtis performed the checkout successfully.
RSI measurements during PC13 showed some disturbances. The cause is
unknown at the time being.
SREM performed a successful checkout.
 
More detailed results can be found in [RO-SGS-RP-0029].
 
 
Cruise phase 6    (8 Jun 2011 - 20 Jan 2014)
--------------
The whole period was spent in Deep-Space Hibernation Mode (DSHM).
Maximum distances to Sun and Earth are encountered during this
period, i.e. 5.3 AU (aphelion) and 6.3 AU, respectively. During this
phase, 3 superior solar conjuctions and 2 solar oppositions occured
(see table above). This phase ended with the Spacecraft wake-up on
the 20th of January 2014.
 
Rendez-Vous Manouver 2  (21 Jan 2014 - 9 Sep 2014)
----------------------
The RVM2 started after Spacecraft wake-up and until September 2014,
when the Global Mapping phase started. It contained the Near Comet
Drift (NCD), the Far Approach Trajectory (FAT) and the Close Approach
Trajectory (CAT). It ended with the transition to Global Mapping.
During this phase, Rosetta did a serie of ten OCMs, starting on the
7 May to reduce its speed with respect to comet 67P/C-G by about
775 m/s. The first, producing just 20 m/s delta-v ( change in
velocity ), was done as a small test burn, as it was the first use of
the spacecraft s propulsion system after wake-up.
 
--Near comet drift (NCD) phase (21 May 2014 - 2 July 2014)
  The following three OCMs form the Near Comet Drift (NCD) phase.
  They took place every two weeks starting 21 May. They delivered
  289.6, 269.5 and 88.7 m/s in delta-v, respectively.
 
-- Far Approach Trajectory (FAT)  (2 July - 3 August 2014)
  The FAT contained the next four burns. The four FAT burns was
  carried out weekly during July, and all proceeded nominally. The
  approach manoeuvre sequence reduced the relative velocity in stages
  down to 3 m/s.
  During this phase, the first images of the comet were obtained with
  the optical measurement system (NAVCAM, OSIRIS). After detection,
  knowledge of the comet ephemeris was drastically improved by
  processing the on-board observations. Image processing on the ground
  derived a coarse estimation of comet size, shape and rotation.
  The first landmarks were identified.
 
  The FAT ends at the Approach Transition Point (ATP), which is
  located in the Sun direction at about 1000 comet nucleus radii from
  the nucleus.

-- Close Approach Trajectory (CAT)
  Close approach trajectory operations started at ATP. The spacecraft
  distance to the comet was decreased to 20 nucleus radii and the
  relative velocity fell below 1 m/s. The final point of this phase
  was the Orbit Insertion Point (OIP), the point where the spacecraft
  started orbiting the comet.
  During the CAT, 5 landing sites were selected by the Landing team.
  Details of the final manoeuvres to prepare insertion:
    6 August: Rosetta was commanded to conduct a 1-m/s thruster burn
    (which ran 7 min) to change its direction and enter onto the first
    arc (of three arcs) of two triangular (really, tetrahedral) orbits
    about the comet.
    It is important to note Rosetta has not been captured by 67P/C-G
    gravity, and the continuing series of thruster burns were
    necessary to keep the spacecraft at the comet.
 
    Rosetta executed two of these triangular orbits, one large, at
    about 100km closest pass-by distance (Big CAT) and the second at
    about 50km ( Little CAT ).
 
    10 August: CAT Change 1 burn - a 6min:25sec, 0.88-m/s burn that
    pushed Rosetta onto the next arc (100km pass-by height).
 
    13 August: CAT Change 2 burn - a 6min:22sec, 0.87-m/s burn that
    pushed Rosetta onto the next arc (100km pass-by height).
 
    17 August: CAT Change 3 burn - a 6min:19sec, 0.85-m/s burn that
    pushed Rosetta onto a transfer arc, down to about 80 km height
    achieved on 20 Aug (CAT 4).
 
    Finally, with the next two burns on 24 and 27 August, the distance
    was lowered to 50km.
 
 - Transition to Global Mapping (TGM)
  On 31 August, Rosetta began the third and last arc of Little CAT
  and Rosetta entered the TGM, a set of two manoeuvres.
  The phase ended at 10 nucleus radii with ta relative velocity of
  0.3 m/s.
 
Global Mapping and Close Observations (10 sep 2014 - 28 Oct 2014)
The Global Mapping phase ran 10 September to 15 October. During this
phase, Rosetta went down to 29 km distance, a point when the
spacecraft became actively captured by the comet gravity, and its
orbit became circular.
 
At the beginning of this phase, the Lander team down selected 2
landing sites: the nominal and the back up.
 
A series of manoeuvres reduced Rosetta distance from 18.6 km orbit
(taking 7 days) to an intermediate orbit approximately 18.6 x 9.8 km
(with a period of 5 days). From there the orbit was circularised at
about 9.8 km radius, with a period of approximately 66 hours on 15
October, and the mission entered the Close Observation Phase (COP).
This phase provided even higher resolution images of the landing
site in order to best prepare for Philae&apos;s challenging touch-down.
The new orbit also allowed a number of Rosetta&apos;s science instruments
to collect dust and measure the composition of gases closer to the
nucleus.
 
On the 28 October, Rosetta conducted a thruster burn (82 sec from
12:59 UTC) that delivered a delta-v of 0.081 meters/sec. This pushed
the spacecraft to leave the 10-km-altitude circular orbit (following
the terminator line) and the COP. Rosetta started its transition to
the pre-lander-delivery orbit.
On 31 October, the mission control team performed another manoeuvre
to enter onto the pre-delivery orbit proper.
 
Lander delivery
---------------
On 31 October, Rosetta entered a pre-delivery elliptical orbit at
approximately 30 km distance from the comet centre. This orbit was
maintained until delivery on 12 November.
The orbiter performed its pre-separation manoeuvre at 6:04 on 12
November, which placed it on the trajectory required for separation.
The separation occurred at 08:35 UTC (the confirmation signal arrived
on Earth at 09:03 UTC). At 10:34 UTC the Lander activated its
transmitters and started forwarding its telemetry to the orbiter. At
11:08 UTC, this telemetry was received on ground.
Touchdown was confirmed for Philae at 16:03 UTC.
While Lander telemetry kept flowing towards the Orbiter, the RF link
between the two crafts was regularly interrupted, which was not
consistent with a stable landing. Other Lander telemetry gave
indication that the Lander had bounced after initial touch-down.
The link between Orbiter and Lander was broken at 17:59 UTC one hour
earlier than expected for the targeted landing site.
On 13 November Lander telemetry was received on ground at 6:01 UTC,
very close to the expected time.
 
During the descent, ROLIS acquired an image at 14:38:41 UT, from a
distance of approximately 3 km from the surface. The landing site was
imaged with a resolution of about 3m per pixel.
 
After separation, Orbiter operations focus on maximising visibility
with the Lander and acquiring data to reconstruct the Lander descent
trajectory and support Orbiter Navigation.
NAVCAM and OSIRIS, once in Lander pointing, acquired every hour until
touch-down + 2 hours. After that, NAVCAM observed every 2 hours for
navigation.
The following Orbiter instruments have been operated: ALICE, CONSERT,
MIRO, OSIRIS, ROSINA, RPC.
 
The post-delivery manoeuvre that has been executed on 12 November 2014
started at 09:14:58.1 UTC and a nominal end time at 09:19:53.7 UTC.
Rosetta was then on a 50 km orbit.
On 13 November at 19:23 UTC Philae started transferring data to
Rosetta. Link was lost at 23:08 UTC on 13 November, 40 minutes before
predicted time.
During this slot was commanded:
- ranging measurements by CONSERT (Lander Search)
- CIVA images
- MUPUS boom deployment and hammering
- APXS deployment and measurement
On 14 November at 9:01, Philae data were received on-board Rosetta and
immediately transmitted to ground, 48 minutes after expected time. The
visibility period finished at 11:47 UTC on 14 November, 50 minutes
earlier than predicted.
During this period was commanded:
- APXS released but measured copper thus revealing that the door had
  not opened.
- MUPUS deployment was successful, hammering took place, SESAME
  detected it
- Drill activation for sample return to COSAC
- PTOLEMY/COSAC spectra acquisitions
- CIVA image but dark.................................................
- Consert ranging
The fourth and last Philae visibility period started on 14 November at
22:15 UTC ground time. The LAnder bus voltage appeared to decrease
rapidly. On November 15 at 00:07, the link between Orbiter and Lander
broke.
Among the Lander operations carried out during the fourth visibility
period was a rotation of the Lander to increase the illumination of
its solar arrays.
 
After the planned Touch Down, the Lander did not anchor and bounced.
We estimated that the first TD was:
    Time UTC: 15:34:06
    Comet-fixed coordinates: [2.129171, -0.961358, 0.498268] km
The NAVCAM image, the NAC image and the first TD as the starting point
gave the following impact point at:
    Time UTC: 16:26:23
    Comet-fixed coordinates: [2.450, -0.511, -0.242] km
This point has an uncertainty of 7 minutes. The position is also
uncertain.
By using three WAC images, the second TD can be deduced:
    Time UTC: 17:31:10
    Comet-fixed coordinates: [2.275, 0.249, -0.444] km
Consert Ranging estimated a final landing site at
Comet-fixed coordinates: [2.446, -0.055, -0.360] km
 
After Touch Down, began the First Science Sequence (FSS) where all
Lander instruments operated on the primary battery. The operations
did not go as planned due to the several TDs but occurred as listed
above. The Long Term Science Phase should have started after the
primary battery died, but the final TD let the Lander in a location
where the illumination condition could not allow battery charging.
Contact was lost on 15 November 2014 at 00:07, ending the FSS, and the
Lander went asleep.
 
Escort phase
------------
Planning period during the comet phase were approximately monthly and
allowed changes in trajectory types every two weeks. The table below
summarises the trajectory followed by Rosetta after the Landing:
21 Nov - 3  Dec 2014  |  Bound Orbits at 30 km
3  Dec - 6  Dec 2014  |  Transition

Orbiter Experiments
=====================================================================
 
ALICE
-----
ALICE, an Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer, characterise the
composition of the nucleus and coma, and the nucleus/coma coupling of
comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. This is accomplished through the
observation of spectral features in the extreme and far ultraviolet
(EUV/FUV) spectral regions from 70 to 205 nm.
 
ALICE make measurements of noble gas abundances in the coma, the
atomic budget in the coma, and major ion abundances in the tail and
in the region where solar wind particles interact with the ionosphere
of the comet. ALICE determine the production rates, variability,
and structure of H2O and CO, and CO2 gas surrounding the nucleus and
the far-UV properties of solid grains in the coma.
 
ALICE studied Mars and the Rosetta asteroid flyby targets while en
route to Churyumov- Gerasimenko. ALICE also map the cometary nucleus
in the FUV
 
Instrument References: [STERNETAL2007]
 
CONSERT
-------
CONSERT (Comet Nucleus Sounding Experiment by Radio wave
Transmission) is an experiment that perform tomography of the
comet nucleus revealing its internal structure. CONSERT operates as a
time domain transponder between the Lander on the comet surface and
the Orbiter. A radio signal passes from the orbiting component of the
instrument to the component on the comet surface and is then
immediately transmitted back to its source, the idea being to
establish a radio link that passes through the comet nucleus. The
varying propagation delay as the radio waves pass through different
parts of the cometary nucleus is used to determine the dielectric
properties of the nuclear material. Many properties of the comet
nucleus is examined as its overall structural homogeneity, the average
 size of the sub-structures (Cometesimals) and the number and
 thickness of the various layers beneath the surface.
 
Instrument References: [KOFMANETAL2007]
 
COSIMA
------
The Cometary Secondary Ion Mass Analyser is a secondary ion mass
spectrometer equipped with a dust collector, a primary ion gun, and
an optical microscope for target characterization. Dust from the near
comet environment is collected on a target. The target is then moved
under a microscope where the positions of any dust particles are
determined. The cometary dust particles are then bombarded with pulses
of indium ions from the primary ion gun. The resulting secondary ions
are extracted into the time-of-flight mass spectrometer.
 
Instrument References: [KISSELETAL2007]
 
GIADA
-----
The Grain Impact Analyser and Dust Accumulator measures the
scalar velocity, size and momentum of dust particles in the coma of
the comet using an optical grain detection system and a mechanical
grain impact sensor. Five microbalances measure the amount of
dust collected as the spacecraft orbits the comet.
 
Instrument References: [COLANGELIETAL2007]
 
MIDAS
-----
The Micro-Imaging Dust Analysis System is intended for the
microtextural and statistical analysis of cometary dust particles.
The instrument is based on the technique of atomic force microscopy.
This technique, under the conditions prevailing at the Rosetta
Orbiter permits textural and other analysis of dust particles to be
performed down to a spatial resolution of 4nm.
 
Instrument References: [RIEDLERETAL2007]
 
MIRO
----
MIRO (Microwave Instrument for the Rosetta Orbiter) is composed of a
millimetre wave mixer receiver and a submillimetre heterodyne
receiver. The submillimetre wave receiver provides both broad band
continuum and high resolution spectroscopic data, whereas the
millimetre wave receiver provides continuum data only.
 
MIRO measures the near surface temperature of the comet, allowing
estimation of the thermal and electrical properties of the surface.
In addition, the spectrometer portion of MIRO allows measurements
of water, carbon monoxide, ammonia, and methanol in the comet coma.
 
Instrument References: [GULKISETAL2007]
 
OSIRIS
------
OSIRIS (Optical, Spectroscopic, and Infrared Remote Imaging System)
is a dual camera imaging system operating in the visible, near
infrared and near ultraviolet wavelength ranges. OSIRIS consists of
two independent camera systems sharing common electronics. The narrow
angle camera is designed to produce high spatial resolution images of
the nucleus of the target comet. The wide angle camera has a wide
field of view and high straylight rejection to image the dust and gas
directly above the surface of the nucleus of the target comet. Each
camera is equipped with filter wheels to allow selection of imaging
wavelengths for various purposes. The spectroscopic and wider band
infrared imaging capabilities originally proposed and incorporated in
the instrument name were descoped during development.
 
Instrument References: [KELLERETAL2006]
 
ROSINA
------
ROSINA (Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis)
consists of two mass spectrometers, since no one technique is able to
achieve the resolution and accuracy required to fulfil the ROSETTA
mission goals over the range of molecular masses under analysis. In
addition, two pressure gauges provide density and velocity data for
the cometary gas.
 
The two mass analysers are:
* A double focusing magnetic mass spectrometer with a mass range of 1
- 100 amu and a mass resolution of 3000 at 1 % peak height, optimised
for very high mass resolution and large dynamic range
* A reflectron type time-of-flight mass spectrometer with a mass
range of 1 -300 amu and a mass resolution better than 500 at 1 % peak
height, optimised for high sensitivity over a very broad mass range
 
Instrument References: [BALSIGERETAL2007]
 
RPC
---
RPC (Rosetta Plasma Consortium) is a set of five sensors sharing a
common electrical and data interface with the Rosetta orbiter. The
RPC sensors are designed to make complementary measurements of the
plasma environment around the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.
 
The RPC sensors are:
* ICA: an Ion Composition Analyser, which measures the three-
  dimensional velocity distribution and mass distribution of positive
  ions;
* IES: an Ion and Electron Sensor, which simultaneously measures
  the flux of electrons and ions in the plasma surrounding the comet;
* LAP: a Langmuir Probe, which measures the density, temperature
  and flow velocity of the cometary plasma;
* MAG: a Fluxgate Magnetometer, which measures the magnetic field
  in the region where the solar wind plasma interacts with the comet;

RSI
---
RSI (Radio Science Investigation) makes use of the communication
system that the Rosetta spacecraft uses to communicate with the
ground stations on Earth. Either one-way or two-way radio links can
be used for the investigations. In the one-way case, a signal
generated by an ultra-stable oscillator on the spacecraft is received
on earth for analysis. In the two way case, a signal transmitted from
the ground station is transmitted back to Earth by the spacecraft. In
either case, the downlink may be performed in either X-band or both X
-band and S-band.
 
RSI investigates the nondispersive frequency shifts (classical
Doppler) and dispersive frequency shifts (due to the ionised
propagation medium), the signal power and the polarization of the
radio carrier waves. Variations in these parameters yields
information on the motion of the spacecraft, the perturbing forces
acting on the spacecraft and the propagation medium.

VIRTIS
------
VIRTIS (Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer) is an
imaging spectrometer that combines three data channels in one
instrument. Two of the data channels are committed to spectral
mapping and are housed in the Mapper optical subsystem. The third
channel is devoted solely to spectroscopy and is housed in the High
resolution optical subsystem.
 
The mapping channel optical system is a Shafer telescope consisting
of five aluminium mirrors mounted on an aluminium optical bench. The
mapping channel uses a silicon charge coupled device (CCD) to detect
wavelengths from 0.25 micron to 1 micron and a mercury cadmium
telluride (HgCdTe) infrared focal plane array (IRFPA) to detect from
0.95 micron to 5 microns.
 
The high resolution channel is an echelle spectrometer. The incident
light is collected by an off-axis parabolic mirror and then
collimated by another off-axis parabola before entering a cross-
dispersion prism. After exiting the prism, the light is diffracted by
a flat reflection grating, which disperses the light in a direction
perpendicular to the prism dispersion. The high-resolution channel
employs a HgCdTe IRFPA to perform detection from 2 to 5 microns.

SREM
----
The Standard Radiation Environment Monitor (SREM) is a monitor-class
instrument intended for space radiation environment characterisation
and radiation housekeeping purposes. SREM provides continuous
directional, temporal, and spectral data of high-energy electron,
proton, and cosmic ray fluxes encountered along the orbit of the
spacecraft, as well as measurements of the total accumulated
radiation dose absorbed by SREM itself.
 
This instrument is a facility monitor flown on several ESA
spacecrafts. It is not considered as a PI (Principal Investigator)
instrument.

LANDER (PHILAE)
=====================================================================
 
The 100 kg Rosetta Lander, named Philae, is the first spacecraft
ever to make a soft landing on the surface of a comet nucleus. The
Lander is provided by a European consortium under the leadership of
the German Aerospace Research Institute (DLR) and the French Space
Research Center (CNES). Other members of the consortium are ESA and
institutes from Austria, Finland, France, Hungary, Ireland, Italy and
the UK. A descripion of the Lander can be found in [RO-EST-RS-3020].
 
The box-shaped Lander was carried in piggyback fashion on the side of
the Orbiter until it arrived at Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Once
the Orbiter was aligned correctly, the ground station commanded the
Lander to self-eject from the main spacecraft and unfold its three
legs, ready for a gentle touch down at the end of the ballistic
descent. The Landing is described above.
 
Immediately after touchdown, a harpoon was supposed to fire to anchor
the Lander to the ground and prevent it escaping from the comet&apos;s
extremely weak gravity. The system did not work and the Lander bounced
several times.
 
Science Objectives
------------------
It is the general aim of the scientific experiments carried and
operated by the Rosetta Lander to obtain a first in situ composition
analysis of primitive material from the early solar system, to study
the composition and structure of a cometary nucleus, reflecting
growth processes in the early solar system, to provide ground truth
data for the Rosetta Orbiter experiments and to investigate dynamic
processes leading to changes in cometary activity.
 
The primary objective of the Rosetta Lander mission is the in situ
investigation of the elemental, isotopic, molecular and mineralogic
composition and the morphology of early solar system material as it
is preserved in the cometary nucleus. Measurement of the absorption
and phase shift of electromagnetic waves penetrating the comet
nucleus will help to determine its internal structure. Seismometry
and magnetometry will also be used to investigate the interior of the
comet.
 
The scientific objectives of the Rosetta Lander can be listed
according to their priority as follows:
1. Determination of the composition of cometary surface and
   subsurface matter: bulk elemental abundances, isotopic ratios,
   minerals, ices, carbonaceous compounds, organics, volatiles - also
   in dependence on time and insolation.
2. Investigation of the structure and physical properties of the
   cometary surface: topography, texture, roughness, regolith scales,
   mechanical, electrical, optical, and thermal properties,
   temperatures. Characterization of the near surface plasma
   environment.
3. Investigation of the global internal structure.
4. Investigation of the comet/plasma interaction.
 
The in situ measurements performed by the Rosetta Lander instruments
will also provide local ground truth to calibrate Orbiter
instruments.
 
Lander Experiments
------------------
The Rosetta-Lander is equipped with a Sample Drill &amp; Distribution
(SD2) subsystem which is in charge to collect cometary surface
samples at given depth and distribute them to the following
instruments: CIVA-M (microscope (MS) &amp; Infrared Spectrometer (IS)),
the ovens, serving COSAC and PTOLEMY.
 
Comet sample from pre-determinated and/or known (measured) depth are
collected and transported by SD2 to well defined locations:
* MS &amp; IS viewing place
* ovens for high temperature (800 deg C) heating
* ovens for medium temperature (130 deg C) heating.
* ovens with a window, where samples can be investigated by CIVA-M
 
Here a description of all the instruments of the Lander:
 
APXS: Alpha-p-X-ray spectrometer
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The goal of the Rosetta APXS experiment is the determination of the
chemical composition of the landing site and its potential alteration
during the comet&apos;s approach to the Sun. The data obtained is
used to characterize the surface of the comet, to determine the
chemical composition of the dust component, and to compare the dust
with known meteorite types.

CIVA: Panoramic and microscopic imaging system
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The Cometary Infrared and Visible Analiser (CIVA) is an integrated
set of imaging instruments, designed to characterize the landing and
sampling site, the 360 deg panorama as seen from the Rosetta Lander,
all samples collected and delivered by the Drill Sample and
Distribution System, and the stratigraphy within the boreholes. It is
constituted by a panoramic stereo camera (CIVA-P), and a microscope
coupled to an IR spectrometer (CIVA-M). CIVA is sharing a common
Imaging Main Electronics (CIVA/ROLIS/IME) with ROLIS. CIVA-P will
characterize the landing site, from the landing legs to the local
horizon. The camera is composed of 6 identical micro-cameras, mounted
of the Lander sides, with their optical axes separated by 60 deg. In
addition, stereoscopic capability is provided by one additional micro-
camera, identical to and co-aligned with one of the panoramic micro-
camera, with its optical axis 10 cm apart.
 
CIVA-M combines in separated boxes, two ultra-compact and
miniaturized channels, one visible microscope CIVA-M/V and one IR
spectrometer CIVA-M/I, to characterize, by non-destructive analyses,
the texture, albedo, mineralogical and molecular composition of each
of the samples collected and distributed by the Drill Sample and
Distribution System.

CONSERT: Radio sounding, nucleus tomography
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The Comet Nucleus Sounding Experiment by Radio wave Transmission
(CONSERT) is a complex experiment that performs tomography of the
comet nucleus revealing its internal structure. CONSERT operates as a
time domain transponder between the Lander, on the comet surface and
the Orbiter orbiting the comet. A radio signal passes from the
orbiting component of the instrument to the component on the comet
surface and is then immediately transmitted back to its source, the
idea being to establish a radio link that passes through the comet
nucleus. The varying propagation delay as the radio waves pass through
different parts of the cometary nucleus is used to determine the
dielectric properties of the nuclear material. Many properties of the
comet nucleus is examined as its overall structural homogeneity, the
average size of the sub-structures (Cometesimals) and the number and
thickness of the various layers beneath the surface.

COSAC: Evolved gas analyser - elemental and molecular composition
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The COmetary SAmpling and Composition experiment COSAC is one of the
two &apos;evolved gas analysers&apos; (EGAs) on board the Rosetta-Lander.
Whereas the other EGA, Ptolemy, aims mainly at accurately measuring
isotopic ratios of light elements, the COSAC is specialised on
detection and identification of complex organic molecules. The
instrument can be described as an effort to analyse in situ, mainly
with respect to the composition of the volatile fraction, cometary
matter nearly as well and accurately as could be done in a laboratory
on Earth. Due to the Rosetta Lander rotatability, the instrument can
conduct analyses and investigations at different spots of the landing
site and, aided by the drill, take samples for analysis from a depth
up to at least 0.2 m.
Instrument References: [GOESMANNETAL2007]
 
PTOLEMY: Evolved gas analyser - isotopic composition
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The size of a small shoe box and weighing less than 5 kg, Ptolemy
uses gas chromatography / mass spectrometry (GCMS) techniques to
investigate the comet surface &amp; subsurface. The instrument concept is
termed &apos;MODULUS&apos; which is taken to mean Methods Of Determining and
Understanding Light elements from Unequivocal Stable isotope
compositions. The scientific goal of the PTOLEMY is to understand the
geochemistry of light elements, such as hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen
and oxygen, by determining their nature, distribution and stable
isotopic compositions.

MUPUS: Measurements of surface and subsurface properties
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The Multi-Purpose Sensor Experiment actually consists of four parts:
1. A penetrator, approximately 40 cm long, is hammered into the
ground about 1m apart from the Lander for measuring during the
penetration process the mechanical strength of the material by means
of a depth sensor and a densitometer. The penetrator is equipped with
a series of temperature sensors and heaters for determining the
temperature as a function of depth and insolation.
2. An accelerometer and a temperature sensor accommodated in the
harpoon(s)
3. A four-channel infrared radiometer measures surface temperatures
in the vicinity of the Lander. Density of the nearsurface (down to
20cm) material is determined by measuring the absorption of
gamma-rays emitted from a radioactive isotope mounted at the tip of
the penetrator.

ROLIS: Descent &amp; Down-Looking Imaging
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The ROLIS Camera (Rosetta Lander Imaging System) delivered first
close-ups of the environment of the landing place of comet
67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko during the descent.
After landing ROLIS made high-resolved investigations to study
the structure (morphology) and mineralogy of the surface.

ROMAP: Magnetometer and plasma monitor
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The Rosetta Lander Magnetometer and Plasma Monitor ROMAP is a multi-
sensor experiment. The magnetic field is measured with a fluxgate
magnetometer. An electrostatic analyzer with integrated Faraday cup
measures ions and electrons. The local pressure is measured with
Pirani and Penning sensors. The sensors are situated on a short boom.
The deployment on the surface of a cometary nucleus demanded the
development of a special digital magnetometer of little weight and
small power requirements. For the first time a magnetic sensor is
operated from within a plasma sensor. A prototype of the
magnetometer, named SPRUTMAG, was flown on space station MIR.

SD2: Sampling, Drilling and Distribution Subsystem
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The sampling, drilling and distribution (SD2) subsystem provides
microscopes and advanced gas analysers with samples collected at
different depths below the surface of the comet. Specifically SD2 can
bore up to 250 mm into the surface of the comet and collect samples
of material at predetermined and/or known depths. It then transports
each sample to a carousel which feeds samples to different instrument
stations: a spectrometer, a volume check plug, ovens for high and
medium temperatures and a cleaning station. SD2 is accommodated
on the flat ground-plate of the Rosetta, where it is exposed to
the cometary environment.

GROUND SEGMENT
=====================================================================
 
This section summarizes the roles and responsabilities for the
Rosetta Ground Segment.
 
The primary responsibility for developing the payload operations
strategy for the Rosetta Scientific Mission is the Rosetta Science
Working Team. The Rosetta Science Working Team (SWT) monitors and
advises on all aspects of Rosetta which affect its scientific
performance.
 
Rosetta Ground Segment
-----------------------
The Rosetta ground segment consists of two major elements: the
Rosetta Mission Operations Centre (RMOC) and the Rosetta Science
Ground Segment (RSGS).
 
Rosetta Science Ground Segment
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The Rosetta Science Ground Segment (RSGS) is located at the
European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC) in Spain. The main task is to
support the Rosetta Project Scientist in the planning of the science
operations schedule and in the generation of coordinated operational
sequences, the payload command sequences for all Rosetta instruments
and their onward transmission to the Rosetta Mission Operations Centre
(RMOC). In addition, the RSGS prepares the trajectory during the comet
escort phase.
 
Rosetta Mission Operations Center
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The Rosetta Mission Operations Center (RMOC) is located at the
European Space Operations Center (ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany. The
RMOC is responsible for the Spacecraft operations and all real time
contacts with the spacecraft and payload, the overall mission
planing, flight dynamics and spacecraft and payload data
distribution.
 
Rosetta Lander Ground Segment
------------------------------
The Rosetta Lander Ground Segment (RLGS) is made up of two
operational teams. When CNES joined the DLR consortium for developing
the Lander, it was decided to divide the RLGS into 2 centers (see
Lander Project Plan [RL-PL-DLR-97002]).
These teams are responsible for the success of the Lander operations,
to ensure that the Lander performs the science with regards to its
status, and to give the data to the PI&apos;s and suppliers.
 
Lander Control Center
- - - - - - - - - - - -
The Lander Control Center (LCC), located at DLR/MUSC in Koeln
(Germany), in charge of Rosetta Lander operations during the flight
segment definition, design, realization, assembly and tests.
 
Science Operations and Navigation Center
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The Science Operations and Navigation Center is under CNES
responsibility, located in Toulouse (France). It is responsible for
the navigation and mission analysis aspects, including separation,
landing and descent strategies and generation of the scientific
sequences.
 
Rosetta Scientific Data Archive
--------------------------------
All scientific data obtained during the full mission duration
remains proprietary of the PI teams and the Lander teams for a maximum
period of 6 months after they have been received from ESOC. After
this period, the scientific data products from the mission have to be
submitted to RSOC in a reduced and calibrated form such that they can
be used by the scientific community. The Archive Scientist prepares
the release of Rosetta Scientific Data Archive after reception from
the individual Rosetta instruments and after the 6 months proprietary
period.

<field name="instrument_description">The Infrared Interferometer Spectrometer and Radiometer (IRIS) instrument on board of Voyager 1 is used to investigate energy balances and atmospheric composition, such as vertical temperature profiles of the planets and satellites. It also investigates the composition, thermal properties, and size of particles in Saturn&#8217;s rings. IRIS consists of a Michelson interferometer for measurements in the thermal infrared and a single channel radiometer that operates in the visible and near infrared. The two components of the instrument share a 50 cm Cassegrain telescope with an effective focal length of 303.5 cm and an angular field of view of 0.25 degree. Entering light is divided into two beams by a dichroic mirror, with longer than ~2.5 micrometers going to the infrared interferometer, and radiation between 0.33 and 2 micrometers going to the radiometer. The effective spectral range of the interferometer is 180-2500 cm**-1 and the apodized spectral resolution is 4.3 cm**-1. The detector of the infrared interferometer is a low-impedance Schwartz-type four-junction thermopile with a thermal time constant of 12 millisecond and is operated at a temperature of 200 K. To minimize systematic errors from possible small changes in the instrument responsivity, the calibration must be updated as a function of time during the encounter. Sampled Visible Radiance is a series of 8 radiometer samples taken during a 48 second data frame with the high gain channel, while Integrated Visable Radiance is the broadband, reflected solar radiometer signal integrated over the 45.6 seconds in that IRIS data are taken within the 48 second data frame. The quantity given is power at the detector in Watts. Note that a systematic error on the order of 10% may exist in the calibration of one or both of the IRIS instruments&apos; radiometer systems.</field>

  Science Objectives
  ==================
    The Planetary Radio Astronomy (PRA) experiments&apos; primary
    objective was to locate and explain kilometric, hectometric,
    and decametric radio emissions from the planets; to measure
    plasma resonances near the giant planets; and to detect
    lightning on the giant planets.  The instrument was also
    successful at observing solar radio emissions from the
    perspective of the outer solar system.
 
    Radio emissions can be used to determine the rate of rotation
    of the inner core of a planet, to determine the existence of a
    magnetic field, and to search for magnetic anomalies.  Radio
    emissions are often the only remote diagnostic for interactions
    occurring in the portions of magnetospheres through which a
    spacecraft does not pass.  This is particularly true for the
    inner magnetosphere, which usually goes unsampled.
 
    Further information on the instrument and the investigations
    performed can be found in [WARWICKETAL1997].
 
 
  Instrument Description
  ======================
    The Voyager Planetary Radio Astronomy (PRA) instrument
    consisted of two superheterodyne receivers, one for the range
    from 1326.0 to 1.2 kHz (center frequency) and a second for the
    range 40.55 to 1.53 MHz (center frequency).  The channels are
    numbered so that the lowest frequency channel (1.2 kHz) is
    channel number 198.  Channels in the range 1 to 128 are
    referred to as &apos;high band&apos;, and the remaining channels as &apos;low
    band&apos;.  In low band, the channel spacing is 19.2 kHz.  In high
    band, the channel spacing is 307.2 kHz.
 
    The PRA receiver is driven by two orthogonal antennas mounted
    on the spacecraft body.  Each antenna element is made of BeCu
    hollow tubes 0.5 inches in diameter and is 10 meters in length.
    By combining the signals from the two antennas in a 90 degree
    hybrid, the PRA instrument can distinguish between the opposing
    states, left hand and right hand, of circular polarization of
    an incoming wave.
 
    The Planetary Radio Astronomy (PRA) receivers were calibrated
    under environmentally-controlled conditions and over the entire
    frequency and dynamic range of the instruments.  This
    calibration consisted in application of a known narrow-band
    signal across the inputs and recording the receiver outputs.
 
    The laboratory calibrations provided power levels for each data
    number (DN) and each frequency in terms of known inputs across
    the antenna terminals of each of the experiment&apos;s two
    monopoles.  Calibrations were carried out over a range of
    receiver temperatures, but in practice the stability of the
    receiver as a function of temperature and the stability of the
    temperature of the receiver as a function of mission phase and
    the status of the overall spacecraft were such that a single
    calibration for each DN at each frequency could be used.
 
    Receiver output levels were quantized.  The minimum value for
    the wave flux density was frequency dependent varying from
    5.E-20 W M**-2 Hz**-1 at frequencies below 1.5 MHz to 5.E-19 at
    frequencies above 1.5 MHz.  The maximum wave flux density was
    typically 50 dB above the minimum value.  The instrument noise
    level also was frequency dependent.  It was about 1.E-19 W
    M**-2 Hz**-1 below 1.5 MHz.  The noise at 10 MHz was still
    about 1E-19 W M**-2 Hz**-1, increased to about 1.E-17 W M**-2
    Hz**-1 at 25 MHz, and then decreased to an intermediate value
    at 40 MHz.
 
    The low-band and high-band operation of the receiver differ.
    In low-band the receiver operated with a sharply tuned filter
    only 1 kHz broad at the 3 dB points and in high-band, with a
    200 kHz filter.  The gain of the receivers was designed in such
    a way that the output increased discontinuously by 23 dB
    (corresponding to the 200:1 bandwidth ratio) between the lowest
    frequency of high-band and the highest frequency of low-band.
    This caused the instrument output to remain constant across the
    high-band to low-band transition point if its input was
    broadband noise.
 
    If unpolarized radiation fell orthogonally on each monopole,
    the total unpolarized flux density for signals below about 5
    MHz could be roughly estimated to be
 
    S = So (10**(m/1000)),
 
    where m was the channel reading in millibels and So is
 
    So = 1.5E-21 (W/Hz m**2).
 
    No reliable method for estimating the flux density exists for
    frequencies above 5 MHz due to the increasing effect of antenna
    resonances.
 
    Although the PRA instrument had 14 possible operating modes, in
    practice the mode called POLLO was used more than 95% of the
    time.  In POLLO, the receiver swept through all 198 channels in
    sequence from the highest frequency to the lowest.  At each
    frequency step, data were produced every 30 msec, consisting of
    25 msec of integration and 5 msec of switching and settling
    time.  Thus, a full sweep through all 200 channels took 6 sec
    (including 60 msec for two status words).  Between steps the 90
    degree hybrid was switched such that the receiver was sensitive
    to the alternate sense of circular polarization.  This toggling
    between left hand and right hand polarization itself alternated
    with each 6 sec receiver sweep.  Thus, for a given frequency, a
    pair of left hand and right hand measurements were 6 sec
    apart.

  Instrument Description
  ======================
    The magnetic field experiment carried out on the Voyager 1
    mission consists of dual low field (LFM) and high field
    magnetometer (HFM) systems.  The dual systems provide greater
    reliability and, in the case of the LFM&apos;s, permit the
    separation of the spacecraft magnetic fields from the ambient
    fields.  Additional reliability is achieved through electronics
    redundancy.  The wide dynamic ranges of +/- 0.002 G for the
    LFM&apos;s and +/- 20 G for the HFM&apos;s, low quantization uncertainty
    (+/- 12.4, 488 nanoTesla respectively), low sensor RMS noise
    level (0.006 nanoTesla), and the use of data compaction schemes
    to optimize the experiment information rate all combine to
    permit the study of a broad spectrum of phenomena during the
    mission.
 
 
  Science Objectives
  ==================
    The investigations of the magnetic fields and magnetospheres of
    the major planetary systems in the outer Solar System and their
    interactions with the solar wind are primary objectives of the
    space exploration program to be conducted during the Voyager 1
    mission.  In addition, the investigation of the interplanetary
    magnetic field phenomena during the flights is of fundamental
    importance both to the understanding of the magnetospheric
    observations and to a number of outstanding questions in basic
    plasma physics and in the general dynamics of the solar wind.
    If the Heliospheric boundary is penetrated, accurate
    measurement of the interstellar magnetic field is also an
    important objective.
 
 
  Operational Considerations
  ==========================
    There are no special operational considerations for the
    magnetometer described in [BEHANNONETAL1977].  All magnetometer
    data are calibrated.  Three types of in-flight calibrations are
    performed: 1) sensitivity calibrations, 2) zero-level
    calibrations, based on rolls of the spacecraft, and 3) boom-
    alignment calibrations based on the activation of on-board
    coils and resulting data (especially important when dual
    magnetometers are used and in strong fields for any
    magnetometer).  Sensitivity calibrations (for 8 ranges) are
    done approximately once every two months (early in the mission
    they were done more frequently).  The magnetometer team
    generally use one or two axis rolls (cruise maneuvers, CRSMR&apos;s)
    of the spacecraft for zero level calibrations as often as they
    are provided which is variable this is about three times per
    year for the so-called mini-CRSMR&apos;s, which are two axis rolls.
    Full CRSMR&apos;s and z-axis (only) roll-maneuvers have not occurred
    within the last few years (full CRSMR&apos;s and mini&apos;s differ only
    in the number of rolls in each).  The magnetometer team usually
    succeeds in arguing for a series of rolls near each planetary
    encounter.  Boom-alignment calibrations were done once after
    launch and around the time of the Jupiter encounter.  Others
    have been executed, but it has been determined that the inter-
    sensor misalignment is small and constant.
 
 
  Measured Parameters
  ===================
    The following LFM and HFM values are derived from Table 1 in
    [BEHANNONETAL1977].
 
    LFM Dynamic ranges and quantization uncertainty:

    6.  +/- 2100                   +/- .513
    7.  +/- 6400                   +/- 1.56
    8.  +/- 50,000                 +/- 12.2
 
    HFM Dynamic ranges and quantization uncertainty:
 
    Range (nT)               Quantization (nT)
    ----------------------------------------------
    1.  +/- 5E+4                   +/- 12.3
    2.  +/- 2E+6                   +/- 488
 
 
  Calibration Description
  =======================
    The 13 meter Astromast booms have proved in extensive
    pre-flight testing to be highly rigid with respect to bending
    motions but soft to torsional or twisting motion.  Deployment
    repeatability test have shown as much as +/- 7 degrees
    uncertainty in the knowledge of the boom twist angle (about the
    boom axis) at the magnetometer sensor positions, compared with
    +/- 0.5 uncertainty in bend angles (rotation about axes
    orthogonal to the boom axis).  In order to minimize sensor
    alignment uncertainties, a method to estimate an angular
    correction matrix was developed that eliminates most of the
    twist uncertainty and some of the bend uncertainty.  A special
    calibration coil has been wound around the periphery of the
    spacecraft&apos;s high gain antenna to generate, upon command, a
    known magnetic field at both LFM magnetometer sensors.  The
    difference between measurements taken when the coil is turned
    on and off is the coil field, independent of all external
    fields.  Using a 20 turn coil of 1/2 amp yields nominal field
    intensities 0f 33.4 and 6.1 nanoTesla at the inboard and
    outboard sensors, respectively.  All magnetometer data are
    calibrated.  Three types of in-flight calibrations are
    performed: 1) sensitivity calibrations, 2) zero-level
    calibrations, based on rolls of the spacecraft, and 3)
    boom-alignment calibrations based on the activation of on-board
    coils and resulting data (especially important when dual
    magnetometers are used and in strong fields for any
    magnetometer).  Sensitivity calibrations (for 8 ranges) are
    done approximately once every two months (early in the mission
    they were done more frequently).  The magnetometer team
    generally use one or two axis rolls (cruise maneuvers, CRSMR&apos;s)
    of the spacecraft for zero level calibrations as often as they
    are provided which is variable this is about three times per
    year for the so-called mini-CRSMR&apos;s, which are two axis rolls.
    Full CRSMR&apos;s and z-axis (only) roll-maneuvers have not occurred
    within the last few years (full CRSMR&apos;s and mini&apos;s differ only
    in the number of rolls in each).  The magnetometer team usually
    succeeds in arguing for a series of rolls near each planetary
    encounter.  Boom-alignment calibrations were done once after
    launch and around the time of the Jupiter encounter.  Others
    have been executed, but it has been determined that the
    inter-sensor misalignment is small and constant.  For more
    information, consult [BEHANNONETAL1977].
 
 
  LFM and HFM Detectors
  =====================
    Detector Type                  : RING CORE
    Detector Aspect Ratio          : 0.000000
    Nominal Operating Temperature  : 273.000000
 
    Total Fovs                     : 1
    Data Rate                      : UNK
    Sample Bits                    : 12
 
    The magnetometer consists of 6 ring core detectors.  These are
    designated as low field magnetometers (LFM) 1-3 and high field
    magnetometers (HFM) 1-3.  The basic sampling rate is .06 +/-
    .006 seconds.  Sampling rate for the high field system is .6
    seconds.  The detectors measure in the interval of +/- 2.0E+6
    nT for HFM, and +/- 5.0E+4 for LFM.  Nominal operating
    temperature for all detectors is 273 K, though the sensors were
    tested over a range of +/- 60 degrees about the nominal
    temperature.
 
    Both high and low field magnetometer sensors utilize a ring
    core geometry and thus have lower drive power requirements and
    better zero level stability than other types of fluxgates and
    are smaller in size [ACUNA1974].  The cores consist of an
    advanced molybdenum alloy, especially developed in cooperation
    with the Naval Surface Weapons Center, White Oak, Maryland,
    which exhibits extremely low noise and high stability
    characteristics.  The use of this alloy and the ring core
    sensor geometry thus allows the realization of compact, low
    power, ultrastable fluxgate sensors with a noise performance
    that is improved almost an order of magnitude over the best
    previously flown fluxgate sensors.  The HFM&apos;s use specially
    processed miniature ring cores (1 cm diameter) which minimize
    the power required to measure large fields.  This description
    is taken directly from [BEHANNONETAL1977].
 
 
    Vector Components
    -----------------
      The LFM1 detector and the HFM1 detector are designated as the
      detectors which measure the i component of the vector
      (i,j,k).  The LFM2 detector and the HFM2 detector are
      designated as the detectors which measure the j component of
      the vector (i,j,k).  The LFM3 detector and the HFM3 detector
      are designated as the detectors which measure the k component
      of the vector (i,j,k).

      three different sensors.
 
 
  Electronics
  ===========
    The instrument is composed of two completely redundant systems:
    the &apos;P&apos; or primary system and the &apos;S&apos; or secondary system.
 
    The experiment electronics instrumentation consists of the
    flux-gate magnetometer electronics and associated controls, and
    the calibration and data processing electronics.  Complete
    redundancy is provided for the analog to digital converters,
    data and status readout buffers, command decoders and power
    converters.  Thus not only can the two magnetometers of a
    system be interchanged, but considerable cross-strapping within
    the electronics permits interchange of critical internal
    functions as well.  This significantly reduces the impact of
    single-component failure on the ability of the experiment to
    continue successful operation during the mission duration of &gt;
    4 years.  This description is directly transposed from
    [BEHANNONETAL1977] page 249.
 
 
  Operational Modes
  =================
    Data Path Type                 : REALTIME
    Instrument Power Consumption   : 2.200000
 
    In the CRUISE mode, only the LFM subsystem is operating.  The
    basic sample rate in this mode is 50/3 vectors/second.
 
    In the ENCOUNTER mode, both LFM and HFM subsystems are
    operating.  The basic sample rate in this mode is 50/3
    vectors/second for the LFM system and 5/3 vectors/second for
    the HFM system.
 
 
  Instrument Mounting
  ===================
    The LFM is located near the tip of the magnetometer boom and
    the HFM is located near the spacecraft body.  See
    [BEHANNONETAL1977] for a picture of the actual magnetometer
    mounting positions and a complete description.

    orthogonal to the boom axis).  In order to minimize sensor
    alignment uncertainties, a method to estimate an angular
    correction matrix was developed that eliminates most of the
    twist uncertainty and some of the bend uncertainty.  A special
    calibration coil has been wound around the periphery of the
    spacecraft&apos;s high gain antenna to generate, upon command, a
    known magnetic field at both LFM magnetometer sensors.  The
    difference between measurements taken when the coil is turned
    on and off is the coil field, independent of all external
    fields.  Using a 20 turn coil of 1/2 amp yields nominal field
    intensities 0f 33.4 and 6.1 nanoTesla at the inboard and
    outboard sensors, respectively.  All magnetometer data are
    calibrated.  Three types of in-flight calibrations are
    performed: 1) sensitivity calibrations, 2) zero-level
    calibrations, based on rolls of the spacecraft, and 3)
    boom-alignment calibrations based on the activation of on-board
    coils and resulting data (especially important when dual
    magnetometers are used and in strong fields for any
    magnetometer).  Sensitivity calibrations (for 8 ranges) are
    done approximately once every two months (early in the mission
    they were done more frequently).  The magnetometer team
    generally use one or two axis rolls (cruise maneuvers, CRSMR&apos;s)
    of the spacecraft for zero level calibrations as often as they
    are provided which is variable this is about three times per
    year for the so-called mini-CRSMR&apos;s, which are two axis rolls.
    Full CRSMR&apos;s and z-axis (only) roll-maneuvers have not occurred
    within the last few years (full CRSMR&apos;s and mini&apos;s differ only
    in the number of rolls in each).  The magnetometer team usually
    succeeds in arguing for a series of rolls near each planetary
    encounter.  Boom-alignment calibrations were done once after
    launch and around the time of the Jupiter encounter.  Others
    have been executed, but it has been determined that the
    inter-sensor misalignment is small and constant.  For more
    information, consult [BEHANNONETAL1977].
 
 
  LFM and HFM Detectors
  =====================
    Detector Type                  : RING CORE
    Detector Aspect Ratio          : 0.000000
    Nominal Operating Temperature  : 273.000000
 
    Total Fovs                     : 1

    The magnetometer consists of 6 ring core detectors.  These are
    designated as low field magnetometers (LFM) 1-3 and high field
    magnetometers (HFM) 1-3.  The basic sampling rate is .06 +/-
    .006 seconds.  Sampling rate for the high field system is .6
    seconds.  The detectors measure in the interval of +/- 2.0E+6
    nT for HFM, and +/- 5.0E+4 for LFM.  Nominal operating
    temperature for all detectors is 273 K, though the sensors were
    tested over a range of +/- 60 degrees about the nominal
    temperature.
 
    Both high and low field magnetometer sensors utilize a ring
    core geometry and thus have lower drive power requirements and
    better zero level stability than other types of fluxgates and
    are smaller in size [ACUNA1974].  The cores consist of an
    advanced molybdenum alloy, especially developed in cooperation
    with the Naval Surface Weapons Center, White Oak, Maryland,
    which exhibits extremely low noise and high stability
    characteristics.  The use of this alloy and the ring core
    sensor geometry thus allows the realization of compact, low
    power, ultrastable fluxgate sensors with a noise performance
    that is improved almost an order of magnitude over the best
    previously flown fluxgate sensors.  The HFM&apos;s use specially
    processed miniature ring cores (1 cm diameter) which minimize
    the power required to measure large fields.  This description
    is taken directly from [BEHANNONETAL1977].

      designated as the detectors which measure the j component of
      the vector (i,j,k).  The LFM3 detector and the HFM3 detector

  Electronics
  ===========
    The instrument is composed of two completely redundant systems:
    the &apos;P&apos; or primary system and the &apos;S&apos; or secondary system.
 
    The experiment electronics instrumentation consists of the
    flux-gate magnetometer electronics and associated controls, and
    the calibration and data processing electronics.  Complete
    redundancy is provided for the analog to digital converters,
    data and status readout buffers, command decoders and power
    converters.  Thus not only can the two magnetometers of a
    system be interchanged, but considerable cross-strapping within
    the electronics permits interchange of critical internal
    functions as well.  This significantly reduces the impact of
    single-component failure on the ability of the experiment to
    continue successful operation during the mission duration of &gt;
    4 years.  This description is directly transposed from
    [BEHANNONETAL1977] page 249.
 
 
  Operational Modes
  =================
    Data Path Type                 : REALTIME
    Instrument Power Consumption   : 2.200000
 
    In the CRUISE mode, only the LFM subsystem is operating.  The
    basic sample rate in this mode is 50/3 vectors/second.
 
    In the ENCOUNTER mode, both LFM and HFM subsystems are
    operating.  The basic sample rate in this mode is 50/3
    vectors/second for the LFM system and 5/3 vectors/second for
    the HFM system.

    The LFM is located near the tip of the magnetometer boom and
    the HFM is located near the spacecraft body.  See

    INSTRUMENT: INFRARED INTERFEROMETER SPECTROMETER AND RADIOMETER

    Instrument Information
    ======================
      Instrument Id                  : IRIS
      Instrument Host Id             : VG1
      Instrument Name                : INFRARED INTERFEROMETER
                                        SPECTROMETER AND RADIOMETER
      Instrument Type                : INFRARED INTERFEROMETER
 
 
    Instrument Description
    ======================
      The Voyager IRIS instrument consists of a Michelson
      interferometer for measurements in the thermal infrared and a
      single channel radiometer that operates in the visible and near
      infrared.  The two components of the instrument share a 50 cm
      Cassegrain telescope with an effective focal length of 303.5
      cm.  The angular field of view is 0.25 degree.  Light passing
      through the telescope is divided into two beams by a dichroic
      mirror, with that longer than about 2.5 micrometers going to
      the infrared interferometer and radiation between 0.33 and 2
      micrometers going to the radiometer.  The effective spectral
      range of the interferometer is 180-2500 cm**-1 (4-55
      micrometers) and the apodized spectral resolution is 4.3
      cm**-1.  The beam splitter of the interferometer consists of a
      multilayer dielectric coating applied to a cesium iodide
      substrate.  The moving mirror is mounted on one end of a motor
      shaft; the moving mirror of an auxiliary reference
      interferometer is attached to the other end of the shaft.  A
      0.5852 micrometer neon line source is used for the reference
      interferometer; the signal from this unit is used by a phase
      comparator and digital sampling circuit to control the motor
      speed and to quantize the analog signal from the main IR
      detector.  The latter is a low impedance, Schwartz-type
      thermopile with a noise equivalent power (NEP) of about 2E-10
      Watt/Hz**1/2.
 
      The spectral response of the radiometer, which is designed to
      measure the broadband reflected solar radiation, is controlled
      by the dichroic mirror and an additional coating on the
      radiometer side of the mirror.  The radiometer detector is an
      eighteen-junction thermopile with an NEP of 4E-10 Watt/Hz**1/2.
      A sapphire window is placed in front of the detector to reject
      unwanted long-wave radiation that may result from temperature
      gradients within the instrument.  The signal from the
      radiometer detector is fed to a low noise, low-drift dc
      amplifier with a time constant of approximately 2.7 seconds,
      and then to three different output circuits.  The first circuit
      integrates the radiometer signal over the 45.6 seconds it takes
      to record an interferogram, thus providing the average of the
      reflected sunlight during the time the infrared spectrum is
      recorded.  The second and third circuits provide the analog
      signal from the radiometer as well as the signal amplified by a
      factor of 8.  These latter channels are sampled every 6 seconds
      and digitized.  The timing of the samples, and their
      relationship to events in a single-frame read out of an image
      are given in Table 1.

      In order to visualize the effects of quantization uncertainties
      directly, it is sometimes useful to convert the radiometer
      watts at the detector back into data numbers (DN).  The
      relationships are:
 
            For Voyager 1:
 
               Sampled data (normal gain):
                  DNn = (WADn * 1e+08 - 2.51937) / 3.39426
               Sampled data (high gain):
                  DNh = (WADh * 1e+09 - 1.55472) / 4.26206
               Integrated data:
                  DNi = WADi / 1.42145 * 1e+09
 
            For Voyager 2:
 
               Sampled data (normal gain):
                  DNn = (WADn * 1e+08 - 6.33020) / 3.40070
               Sampled data (high gain):
                  DNh = (WADh * 1e+09 + 6.57589) / 4.24459
               Integrated data:
                  DNi = WADi / 1.42047 * 1e+09
 
 
      Pairs of baseline levels are averaged at the beginning and at
      the end of the 45.6 second integrations, occasionally resulting
      in half-integral DN values for the integrated radiometer data.
 
      Despite the stability of the calibration data (see below), a
      small systematic error may remain.  Comparison of spatially
      resolved IRIS observations of Jupiter and Saturn shows that
      reflectivities derived from Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 IRIS
      instruments are in the ratio 0.883:1.  An investigation was
      made of albedos of various objects (Jupiter, Io, Ganymede,
      Callisto, and Saturn), as determined using the two instruments.
      When compared to groundbased determinations, no systematic
      differences were apparent for either instrument, within the
      uncertainties.  Thus, a systematic error on the order of 10%
      may exist in the calibration of one or both of the IRIS
      instruments&apos; radiometer systems.
 
      The temperature of the instrument is passively and actively
      controlled to operate at 200 +/- 0.5 K with a maximum drift of
      +/- 0.1 K/day.  A thermal radiator mounted on the
      interferometer cools the instrument by radiating to deep space.
      Three sets of proportionally controlled heaters provide fine
      thermal control for the primary telescope mirror, secondary
      mirror, and the interferometer.  It is necessary to maintain
      temperature differences between the three components to less
      than 0.1 K.  In addition, high-powered &apos;flash-off&apos; heaters are
      available for increasing the instrument temperature by
      approximately 70 K.  These are controlled by command.  These
      have been used to warm the instrument during cruise periods to
      reverse a gradual change in the elastic properties of a
      silicone compound in the Michelson motor dampers and
      beam-splitter mounts.
 
 
    Science Objectives
    ==================
      The scientific objectives of the Voyager Infrared
      Interferometer Spectrometer (IRIS) investigation include the
      following:
 
     (1)  Identification and determination of the abundances of
          gaseous atmospheric constituents;
     (2)  Determination of the helium abundance of the
          atmospheres of the giant planets;
     (3)  Determination of the energy balances of the giant
          planets through measurements of their total thermal
          emissions and Bond albedos;
     (4)  Determination of the three dimensional thermal
          structure of the atmospheres of the giant planets and
          Titan;
     (5)  Inference of information on atmospheric dynamics;
     (6)  Inference of the infrared optical properties of
          clouds and hazes;
     (7)  Determination of the temperature, composition, and
          structure of the surfaces of satellites without
          atmospheres;
     (8)  Determination of the thermal characteristics of
          Saturn&apos;s rings.
 
      These objectives are accomplished through the analysis of
      measurements of thermal emission spectra and broad band
      reflected solar energy.
 
 
    Operational Considerations
    ==========================
      The IRIS instruments on Voyager 1 and 2 operated normally
      throughout the mission.  The infrared interferometers of both
      instruments experienced a temporal decrease in responsivity,
      believed to be due to a gradual stiffening in silicon compounds
      used in the mirror mounts and motor dampers.  However, this was
      partially reversed by using the flash off heaters to raise the
      temperature of the instrument periodically during cruise
      between encounters.
 
 
    Calibration Description
    =======================
      In-flight calibration of the data from the interferometer is
      accomplished using periodic observations of deep space along
      with a precise knowledge of the instrument cavity temperature.
      Use of the instrument temperature itself as a calibration point
      was necessitated because the large size of the telescope made
      the use of an on-board blackbody target impractical.
 
      The calibration is carried out for each wavenumber interval
      independently using I = B*(Tinst)*(C2 C1)/C2 where I is the
      calibrated planetary radiance, B*(Tinst) is the Planck radiance
      at the instrument temperature Tinst, and C2 and C1 are the
      spectral amplitudes measured while observing the planet and
      deep space, respectively.  This calibration technique requires
      that the interferometer and all elements within its field of
      view, including the telescope mirrors, apertures, and baffles,
      be at precisely the same temperature.  This condition is
      insured through the use of thermostatically controlled heaters.
      To minimize systematic errors from possible small changes in
      the instrument responsivity, the calibration must be updated as
      a function of time during the encounter.
 
      During an encounter, the deep space spectra for each day were
      averaged and a time corresponding to the average time was
      assigned to each average.  In addition to the daily averages, a
      grand average of all deep space spectra was calculated.  For
      each day a ratio spectrum consisting of the daily average power
      spectrum divided by the grand average power spectrum was used
      to scale the grand average instrument response to obtain the
      daily response.  Individual spectra were then calibrated using
      a linear interpolation.  The calibrated spectral radiances are
      expressed in Watt/cm**2/sr/cm**-1.
 
      Radiometer calibration consists of a verification of instrument
      stability by repeated determinations of t(target plate), based
      on observations of a diffusely scattering target plate mounted
      on the spacecraft.  The calibration conversion to Watts at the
      detector takes into account the detector response and
      electrical gains.  Observations of the target plate were
      carried out before and after each encounter with the exception
      of after the Voyager 2 Saturn encounter when jamming of the
      instrument scan platform caused the maneuver to be aborted.
 
      The long term behavior of the target calibration data for the
      two IRIS radiometers is presented in the following tables.  The
      observed target signal, corrected for offsets, and normalized
      for changes in heliocentric distance, has remained constant
      within quantization uncertainties throughout the mission.  In
      the absence of compensating changes in the target plate and the
      instrument, this implies excellent radiometer stability.  The
      arithmetic average of all target measurements, with a 1.5%
      uncertainty, is adopted as the normalized target signal for
      purposes of absolute calibration: 30960 +/- 460 DNi x AU**2;
      this differs slightly from the published value 31152 +/- 312
      DNi x AU**2 [PEARL&amp;CONRATH1991].  The target signals for the
      integrating, x8 sampling, and x1 sampling radiometer data are
      in the ratio 24:8:1.

    Notes:
    [1] Where the difference between pre-encounter and
        post-encounter measurements of space exceeds the random
        baseline variation, the average is taken as the
        arithmetic mean, with the difference as the uncertainty.
    [2] Considers the larger of 0.5% (estimated maximum possible
        nonlinearity) or the baseline variation as the
        uncertainty.
    [3] All uncertainties are considered uncorrelated in
        calculation of the adjusted target signal.
    [4] For Voyager 2 only, the adopted mean value of 30960 +/-
        460 is entered for all cases in the calibration files.
    [5] For Voyager 2 Saturn post-encounter, the instrument
        platform jammed so the calibration maneuver was aborted.
 
 
      Because the spectral transmission of the radiometer is not flat
      across the bandwidth, further calibration requires knowledge of
      the relative spectrum of each object observed.  The absolute
      reflectance of the Voyager 1 and 2 target plates are 0.502 +/-
      0.018 and 0.497 +/- 0.018, respectively.  A detailed
      description of a technique for calibrating the radiometer is
      given in [HANELETAL1981A].
 
 
    Instrument Detectors
    ====================
      The detector of the broadband reflected solar radiometer is an
      eighteen-junction thermopile with a 3 second thermal time
      constant and is operated at a temperature of 200 K.  The
      thermopile used with the broadband radiometer has a noise
      equivalent power of 4E-10 Watt/Hz**1/2.
 
      The detector of the infrared interferometer is a low-impedance
      Schwartz-type four-junction thermopile with a thermal time
      constant of 12 millisecond.  and is operated at a temperature
      of 200 K.  The thermopile used with the interferometer has a
      noise equivalent power of approximately 2E-10 Watt/Hz**1/2.
 
 
    Instrument Electronics
    ======================
      The bulk of the analog and all of the digital circuitry is
      located in an electronics module separate form the
      interferometer module.  The power supply is located in still
      another box.  Only elements that had to be close to detectors
      to minimize noise, such as the sensors for temperature
      measurements and controls, were located in the optics module.
      The electronics box contains timing and control elements,
      mirror drive circuitry, housekeeping monitors, thermal
      controllers, analog-to-digital converters, and spacecraft
      interface circuits.  The power module contains one primary and
      two auxiliary power supplies that convert spacecraft primary ac
      into dc voltages required to operate the instrument.  One of
      the auxiliary supplies is always on to maintain the instrument
      at the proper temperature.  The primary power supply is on only
      when the instrument is on during tests, calibrations and
      observation periods during planetary encounters.  Because of
      the requirement to pass through the Jovian radiation
      environment, hardened electronics components were used where
      possible.  The bulk of the instrument electronics consists of
      radiation-hardened integrated circuits.  A description of the
      electronics, along with a block diagram, is given in
      [HANELETAL1980A].
 
 
    Instrument Optics
    =================
      The Cassegrain telescope has a parabolic primary mirror 50 cm
      in diameter with a 7.62 cm hyperbolic secondary mirror, and an
      effective focal length of 303.5 cm and an F number of 6.07.  A
      dichroic mirror divides the beam from the telescope into two
      separate beams, one going to the infrared interferometer and
      the other to the broadband reflected solar radiometer.  The
      telescope mirrors and support structure, like most of the other
      mechanical parts of the instrument, are made of optical-grade
      beryllium.  The primary mirror is gold coated over a nickel
      plating.  The secondary mirror has an aluminum coating over the
      nickel plating, and this in turn is overcoated with silicon
      monoxide for protection.
 
 
    Instrument Offset
    =================
      The instrument and the associated electronics and power supply
      modules are bolted to the scan platform.  The telescope is
      approximately bore-sighted with the wide and narrow angle
      television cameras, and with the PPS and UVS instruments.
 
 
    Instrument Parameters
    =====================
      The following instrument parameters are measured.
 
      Sampled Visible Radiance - Series of 8 radiometer samples taken
      during a 48 second data frame with the high gain channel.  The
      quantity given is power at the detector in Watts.  (-1.0
      indicates data off the planet).
 
      Integrated Visable Radiance - The broadband, reflected solar
      radiometer signal integrated over the 45.6 seconds that IRIS
      data are taken within the 48 second data frame.  The quantity
      given is power at the detector in Watts.
 
      Thermal Radiance - Radiance (W cm-2 ster-1) within a 4.3 cm-1
      spectral interval.
 
 
    Instrument Modes
    ================
      The instrument possesses only one operating mode.  When turned
      on the instruments acquires one interferogram every 48 second
      data frame.  In addition data from the reflected solar
      radiometer are also obtained every data frame.  The latter
      consist of a measurement integrated over 45.6 seconds as well
      as 8 samples of both high and normal gain measurements
      distributed at 6 second intervals throughout the data frame.

                                        SPECTROMETER AND RADIOMETER
      Instrument Type                : INFRARED INTERFEROMETER
 
 
    Instrument Description
    ======================
      The Voyager IRIS instrument consists of a Michelson
      interferometer for measurements in the thermal infrared and a
      single channel radiometer that operates in the visible and near
      infrared.  The two components of the instrument share a 50 cm
      Cassegrain telescope with an effective focal length of 303.5
      cm.  The angular field of view is 0.25 degree.  Light passing
      through the telescope is divided into two beams by a dichroic
      mirror, with that longer than about 2.5 micrometers going to
      the infrared interferometer and radiation between 0.33 and 2
      micrometers going to the radiometer.  The effective spectral
      range of the interferometer is 180-2500 cm**-1 (4-55
      micrometers) and the apodized spectral resolution is 4.3
      cm**-1.  The beam splitter of the interferometer consists of a
      multilayer dielectric coating applied to a cesium iodide
      substrate.  The moving mirror is mounted on one end of a motor
      shaft; the moving mirror of an auxiliary reference
      interferometer is attached to the other end of the shaft.  A
      0.5852 micrometer neon line source is used for the reference
      interferometer; the signal from this unit is used by a phase
      comparator and digital sampling circuit to control the motor
      speed and to quantize the analog signal from the main IR
      detector.  The latter is a low impedance, Schwartz-type
      thermopile with a noise equivalent power (NEP) of about 2E-10
      Watt/Hz**1/2.
 
      The spectral response of the radiometer, which is designed to
      measure the broadband reflected solar radiation, is controlled
      by the dichroic mirror and an additional coating on the
      radiometer side of the mirror.  The radiometer detector is an
      eighteen-junction thermopile with an NEP of 4E-10 Watt/Hz**1/2.
      A sapphire window is placed in front of the detector to reject
      unwanted long-wave radiation that may result from temperature
      gradients within the instrument.  The signal from the
      radiometer detector is fed to a low noise, low-drift dc
      amplifier with a time constant of approximately 2.7 seconds,
      and then to three different output circuits.  The first circuit
      integrates the radiometer signal over the 45.6 seconds it takes
      to record an interferogram, thus providing the average of the
      reflected sunlight during the time the infrared spectrum is
      recorded.  The second and third circuits provide the analog
      signal from the radiometer as well as the signal amplified by a
      factor of 8.  These latter channels are sampled every 6 seconds
      and digitized.  The timing of the samples, and their
      relationship to events in a single-frame read out of an image
      are given in Table 1.

      In order to visualize the effects of quantization uncertainties
      directly, it is sometimes useful to convert the radiometer
      watts at the detector back into data numbers (DN).  The
      relationships are:
 
            For Voyager 1:
 
               Sampled data (normal gain):
                  DNn = (WADn * 1e+08 - 2.51937) / 3.39426
               Sampled data (high gain):
                  DNh = (WADh * 1e+09 - 1.55472) / 4.26206
               Integrated data:
                  DNi = WADi / 1.42145 * 1e+09
 
            For Voyager 2:
 
               Sampled data (normal gain):
                  DNn = (WADn * 1e+08 - 6.33020) / 3.40070
               Sampled data (high gain):
                  DNh = (WADh * 1e+09 + 6.57589) / 4.24459
               Integrated data:
                  DNi = WADi / 1.42047 * 1e+09
 
 
      Pairs of baseline levels are averaged at the beginning and at
      the end of the 45.6 second integrations, occasionally resulting
      in half-integral DN values for the integrated radiometer data.
 
      Despite the stability of the calibration data (see below), a
      small systematic error may remain.  Comparison of spatially
      resolved IRIS observations of Jupiter and Saturn shows that
      reflectivities derived from Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 IRIS
      instruments are in the ratio 0.883:1.  An investigation was
      made of albedos of various objects (Jupiter, Io, Ganymede,
      Callisto, and Saturn), as determined using the two instruments.
      When compared to groundbased determinations, no systematic
      differences were apparent for either instrument, within the
      uncertainties.  Thus, a systematic error on the order of 10%
      may exist in the calibration of one or both of the IRIS
      instruments&apos; radiometer systems.
 
      The temperature of the instrument is passively and actively
      controlled to operate at 200 +/- 0.5 K with a maximum drift of
      +/- 0.1 K/day.  A thermal radiator mounted on the
      interferometer cools the instrument by radiating to deep space.
      Three sets of proportionally controlled heaters provide fine
      thermal control for the primary telescope mirror, secondary
      mirror, and the interferometer.  It is necessary to maintain
      temperature differences between the three components to less
      than 0.1 K.  In addition, high-powered &apos;flash-off&apos; heaters are
      available for increasing the instrument temperature by
      approximately 70 K.  These are controlled by command.  These
      have been used to warm the instrument during cruise periods to
      reverse a gradual change in the elastic properties of a
      silicone compound in the Michelson motor dampers and
      beam-splitter mounts.
 
 
    Science Objectives
    ==================
      The scientific objectives of the Voyager Infrared
      Interferometer Spectrometer (IRIS) investigation include the
      following:
 
     (1)  Identification and determination of the abundances of
          gaseous atmospheric constituents;
     (2)  Determination of the helium abundance of the
          atmospheres of the giant planets;
     (3)  Determination of the energy balances of the giant
          planets through measurements of their total thermal
          emissions and Bond albedos;
     (4)  Determination of the three dimensional thermal
          structure of the atmospheres of the giant planets and
          Titan;
     (5)  Inference of information on atmospheric dynamics;
     (6)  Inference of the infrared optical properties of
          clouds and hazes;
     (7)  Determination of the temperature, composition, and
          structure of the surfaces of satellites without
          atmospheres;
     (8)  Determination of the thermal characteristics of
          Saturn&apos;s rings.
 
      These objectives are accomplished through the analysis of
      measurements of thermal emission spectra and broad band
      reflected solar energy.
 
 
    Operational Considerations
    ==========================
      The IRIS instruments on Voyager 1 and 2 operated normally
      throughout the mission.  The infrared interferometers of both
      instruments experienced a temporal decrease in responsivity,
      believed to be due to a gradual stiffening in silicon compounds
      used in the mirror mounts and motor dampers.  However, this was
      partially reversed by using the flash off heaters to raise the
      temperature of the instrument periodically during cruise
      between encounters.
 
 
    Calibration Description
    =======================
      In-flight calibration of the data from the interferometer is
      accomplished using periodic observations of deep space along
      with a precise knowledge of the instrument cavity temperature.
      Use of the instrument temperature itself as a calibration point
      was necessitated because the large size of the telescope made
      the use of an on-board blackbody target impractical.
 
      The calibration is carried out for each wavenumber interval
      independently using I = B*(Tinst)*(C2 C1)/C2 where I is the
      calibrated planetary radiance, B*(Tinst) is the Planck radiance
      at the instrument temperature Tinst, and C2 and C1 are the
      spectral amplitudes measured while observing the planet and
      deep space, respectively.  This calibration technique requires
      that the interferometer and all elements within its field of
      view, including the telescope mirrors, apertures, and baffles,
      be at precisely the same temperature.  This condition is
      insured through the use of thermostatically controlled heaters.
      To minimize systematic errors from possible small changes in
      the instrument responsivity, the calibration must be updated as
      a function of time during the encounter.
 
      During an encounter, the deep space spectra for each day were
      averaged and a time corresponding to the average time was
      assigned to each average.  In addition to the daily averages, a
      grand average of all deep space spectra was calculated.  For
      each day a ratio spectrum consisting of the daily average power
      spectrum divided by the grand average power spectrum was used
      to scale the grand average instrument response to obtain the
      daily response.  Individual spectra were then calibrated using
      a linear interpolation.  The calibrated spectral radiances are
      expressed in Watt/cm**2/sr/cm**-1.
 
      Radiometer calibration consists of a verification of instrument
      stability by repeated determinations of t(target plate), based
      on observations of a diffusely scattering target plate mounted
      on the spacecraft.  The calibration conversion to Watts at the
      detector takes into account the detector response and
      electrical gains.  Observations of the target plate were
      carried out before and after each encounter with the exception
      of after the Voyager 2 Saturn encounter when jamming of the
      instrument scan platform caused the maneuver to be aborted.
 
      The long term behavior of the target calibration data for the
      two IRIS radiometers is presented in the following tables.  The
      observed target signal, corrected for offsets, and normalized
      for changes in heliocentric distance, has remained constant
      within quantization uncertainties throughout the mission.  In
      the absence of compensating changes in the target plate and the
      instrument, this implies excellent radiometer stability.  The
      arithmetic average of all target measurements, with a 1.5%
      uncertainty, is adopted as the normalized target signal for
      purposes of absolute calibration: 30960 +/- 460 DNi x AU**2;
      this differs slightly from the published value 31152 +/- 312
      DNi x AU**2 [PEARL&amp;CONRATH1991].  The target signals for the
      integrating, x8 sampling, and x1 sampling radiometer data are
      in the ratio 24:8:1.

    Notes:
    [1] Where the difference between pre-encounter and
        post-encounter measurements of space exceeds the random
        baseline variation, the average is taken as the
        arithmetic mean, with the difference as the uncertainty.
    [2] Considers the larger of 0.5% (estimated maximum possible
        nonlinearity) or the baseline variation as the
        uncertainty.
    [3] All uncertainties are considered uncorrelated in
        calculation of the adjusted target signal.
    [4] For Voyager 2 only, the adopted mean value of 30960 +/-
        460 is entered for all cases in the calibration files.
    [5] For Voyager 2 Saturn post-encounter, the instrument
        platform jammed so the calibration maneuver was aborted.
 
 
      Because the spectral transmission of the radiometer is not flat
      across the bandwidth, further calibration requires knowledge of
      the relative spectrum of each object observed.  The absolute
      reflectance of the Voyager 1 and 2 target plates are 0.502 +/-
      0.018 and 0.497 +/- 0.018, respectively.  A detailed
      description of a technique for calibrating the radiometer is
      given in [HANELETAL1981A].
 
 
    Instrument Detectors
    ====================
      The detector of the broadband reflected solar radiometer is an
      eighteen-junction thermopile with a 3 second thermal time
      constant and is operated at a temperature of 200 K.  The
      thermopile used with the broadband radiometer has a noise
      equivalent power of 4E-10 Watt/Hz**1/2.
 
      The detector of the infrared interferometer is a low-impedance
      Schwartz-type four-junction thermopile with a thermal time
      constant of 12 millisecond.  and is operated at a temperature
      of 200 K.  The thermopile used with the interferometer has a
      noise equivalent power of approximately 2E-10 Watt/Hz**1/2.
 
 
    Instrument Electronics
    ======================
      The bulk of the analog and all of the digital circuitry is
      located in an electronics module separate form the
      interferometer module.  The power supply is located in still
      another box.  Only elements that had to be close to detectors
      to minimize noise, such as the sensors for temperature
      measurements and controls, were located in the optics module.
      The electronics box contains timing and control elements,
      mirror drive circuitry, housekeeping monitors, thermal
      controllers, analog-to-digital converters, and spacecraft
      interface circuits.  The power module contains one primary and
      two auxiliary power supplies that convert spacecraft primary ac
      into dc voltages required to operate the instrument.  One of
      the auxiliary supplies is always on to maintain the instrument
      at the proper temperature.  The primary power supply is on only
      when the instrument is on during tests, calibrations and
      observation periods during planetary encounters.  Because of
      the requirement to pass through the Jovian radiation
      environment, hardened electronics components were used where
      possible.  The bulk of the instrument electronics consists of
      radiation-hardened integrated circuits.  A description of the
      electronics, along with a block diagram, is given in
      [HANELETAL1980A].
 
 
    Instrument Optics
    =================
      The Cassegrain telescope has a parabolic primary mirror 50 cm
      in diameter with a 7.62 cm hyperbolic secondary mirror, and an
      effective focal length of 303.5 cm and an F number of 6.07.  A
      dichroic mirror divides the beam from the telescope into two
      separate beams, one going to the infrared interferometer and
      the other to the broadband reflected solar radiometer.  The
      telescope mirrors and support structure, like most of the other
      mechanical parts of the instrument, are made of optical-grade
      beryllium.  The primary mirror is gold coated over a nickel
      plating.  The secondary mirror has an aluminum coating over the
      nickel plating, and this in turn is overcoated with silicon
      monoxide for protection.
 
 
    Instrument Offset
    =================
      The instrument and the associated electronics and power supply
      modules are bolted to the scan platform.  The telescope is
      approximately bore-sighted with the wide and narrow angle
      television cameras, and with the PPS and UVS instruments.
 
 
    Instrument Parameters
    =====================
      The following instrument parameters are measured.
 
      Sampled Visible Radiance - Series of 8 radiometer samples taken
      during a 48 second data frame with the high gain channel.  The
      quantity given is power at the detector in Watts.  (-1.0
      indicates data off the planet).
 
      Integrated Visable Radiance - The broadband, reflected solar
      radiometer signal integrated over the 45.6 seconds that IRIS
      data are taken within the 48 second data frame.  The quantity
      given is power at the detector in Watts.
 
      Thermal Radiance - Radiance (W cm-2 ster-1) within a 4.3 cm-1
      spectral interval.
 
 
    Instrument Modes
    ================
      The instrument possesses only one operating mode.  When turned
      on the instruments acquires one interferogram every 48 second
      data frame.  In addition data from the reflected solar
      radiometer are also obtained every data frame.  The latter
      consist of a measurement integrated over 45.6 seconds as well
      as 8 samples of both high and normal gain measurements
      distributed at 6 second intervals throughout the data frame.

      Instrument Overview
      ===================
      The low energy charged particle experiment employs a set of
      many solid state detectors arranged to characterize, with
      various levels of energy, directional, and compositional
      discriminations, the in-situ charged particle environment of
      the spacecraft, both within interplanetary and planetary
      magnetospheric regions. Electrons can be characterized, with
      various electron rate energy channels, between 22 keV and
      greater than 10 meV (mode dependent). Ions, without mass
      species discriminations, can be characterized with various ion
      rate energy channels between 28 keV and greater than 152 keV
      (mode dependent). Rate data is telemetered as simple counts
      per accumulation time period. The different channels
      correspond to different onboard energy discrimination windows
      (for ions the discrimination values are mass species
      dependent, leading to some ambiguity). Above about 200
      keV/nucleon, the ions can be discriminated as to their mass
      species composition by the use of multiple parameter
      measurements. These measurements consist of the energies that
      individual particles deposit in more than one detector. This
      information is telemetered both as ion rate data, obtained by
      on-board species identification circuitry (with various
      channels representing various energy-species combinations),
      and as particle multiple parameters data, consisting of pulse-
      height-analysis values from each of the affected particle
      detectors for each analyzed particle. (A maximum of about 2 to
      5 particles per second can be analyzed in this fashion due to
      telemetry limitations. A priority scheme avoids saturation by
      one species group. there are three such groups defined: atomic
      number z = 1,2 each group in a rotating fashion.) Angular
      information is obtained through mechanical rotation of the
      detectors. The main detectors look within a single scan plane
      that is rotated 360 degrees, stopping at 8 different look
      sectors (one of the sectors is blocked to obtain a background
      measurement: sector 8). The lower energy detectors have full
      width viewcones of about 45 degrees. The scan plane is
      oriented such that a line that passes exactly between sectors
      8 and 1, and also exactly between sectors 4 and 5, is exactly
      parallel to the roll axis of the spacecraft (which nominally
      points at earth). When the roll orientation of the spacecraft
      is such that the star sensor is locked on canopus, the scan
      plane is tilted about 30 degrees out of the ecliptic plane,
      with sector 3 tilting towards north ecliptic (and also in the
      direction that is retrograde with respect to the planetary
      orbits). Sectors 1 and 8 point in the general direction of
      earth. The scan rate is variable between 48 seconds to 48
      minutes per 360 degree scan. There are some electron detectors
      (whose properties are not as well established as the others)
      that view out of the scan plane described here (see
      [KRIMIGISETAL1977]). Some of the data is subject to
      substantial contamination depending on the region under
      consideration. Before the data from this instrument can be
      used, it is vital that the contamination descriptions be
      examined (&apos;CONTAMINATION_ DESC&apos;) for each contamination type
      (&apos;CONTAMINATION_ID&apos;) and that the contaminations levels be
      determined (&apos;DATA_QUALITY_ID&apos; AND &apos;DATA_QUALITY_DESC&apos;). While
      sector 8 is the background sector for most (and generally the
      most used) data channels, sector 4 is the background sector
      for some channels. Of those channels documented in this
      catalog, sector 4 is the background sector for channels: ESA0,
      ESB0, AB10, AB12, AB13, PSA1, PSA2, PSA3, PSB1, PSB2, and PSB3.
 
      Science Objectives
      ==================
      Characterize the energy spectra, angular distributions,
      species composition, spatial structures, and temporal
      variations of the hot plasmas, energetic particles, and
      particulate radiation that exist in the vicinity of the outer
      planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) and within the
      interplanetary environment. To study the mechanisms by which
      such particles are energized and transported throughout such
      systems. To study in particular the energization and transport
      processes associated with hot plasmas and particulate
      radiation in the vicinity of planetary bow shocks,
      magnetopauses, magnetotail plasma sheets, inner radiation
      zones, the auroral zones, etc., and to study the interaction
      of such media with planetary satellites and the planetary
      atmospheres and ionospheres.
 
      Operational Considerations
      ==========================
      Instrument operates continuously sampling data over uniform
      accumulation intervals. The accumulation intervals are
      different for the different channels of information (almost
      100 channels). The scan head of the LECP Instrument usually
      scans back-and-forth continuously (forward by 315 degrees and
      then back by 315 degrees). The scanning head pauses at 8
      different scan sectors for periods ranging between 6 seconds
      and 48 seconds (for the encounter time periods) and takes
      about 0.5 seconds to scan between the sectors. Specially
      scanning modes for Voyager 2 at Uranus and Neptune have been
      developed whereby 1 or 2 quick scans are performed followed by
      6 to 12 minutes of no scanning. Also, for Voyager 2 at Jupiter
      there was an extended period of no scanning. The roll
      orientation of the spacecraft is of crucial importance as to
      the type of data returned since that orientation determines
      the orientation of the scan plane of the LECP Instrument. That
      orientation also has safety consequences since a poor
      orientation could expose the LECP detectors to ring
      particulate damage.
 
      Calibration
      ===========
      The instrument was calibrated on the ground by placing it into
      beam chambers (e.g. Van DeGraf machines) and firing calibrated
      beams of known composition at it. Also, a radioactive source
      is positioned behind the &apos;sunshield&apos; positioned at sector 8
      for in-flight calibration of some detector-electronic gains.
      Also, the instrument has a calibration mode whereby pulses of
      known strength are sent into the pre-amplifier chains
      following the detectors. Information about calibration can be
      found in: [KRIMIGSETAL1977], [KRIMIGISETAL1981],

      The LECP Instrument consists of a variety (about 28) of &apos;Solid
      State Detectors&apos; that are used individually and in
      combinations (using coincidence and anti-coincidence
      criterion) to detect and characterize nuclear particles. The
      detector thicknesses range from 2 to 2450 microns to cover a
      very broad range of particle energy and mass characteristic.
 
      Detectors count particles that have appropriate discriminated
      characteristics with an efficiency that approaches 1.
      Therefore the sensitivity is strictly a function of the
      geometric factors of the detectors (geometric factors
      associated with different data channels are documented
      elsewhere in this catalog) and the energy and species band-
      widths of the data channels (also documented elsewhere). The
      geometric factors have units of area X Steradians (CM^2 X
      STR).

      A set of measured parameters which yield multiple pieces of
      information about each particle (generally ions) that Q enters
      the system. These pieces of information can, for example,
      consist of the energy deposited by a single particle in two or
      more separate detectors, or the time-of-flight between two
      different detectors plus the energy deposited in a third, etc..
      The multiple pieces of information can be used to perform mass,
      atomic number, and/or charge state discriminations on ions. The
      information can be discriminated on-board and telemetered in
      the form of ion rate channels, or the multiple information
      about each particle analyzed can be telemetered for obtaining
      the finest species discriminations.

      &apos;LECP&apos; Detector Operational Modes
      =================================
 
      FAR ENCOUNTER
      -------------
      Data Path Type                 : UNK
      Instrument Power Consumption   : 4.725000
 
      Used in the vicinity of planetary encounters. High intensity
      detectors turned off (A, B, DELTA, DELTA PRIME). (Affected
      channels are documented in detailed level catalog.) Bit Rate
      allocated 1/3 for Particle Multiple Parameters (PMP) data, also
      called Pulse Height Analysis data, and 2/3 for Rate data
      (counts/second). Full composition discrimination capabilities
      enabled (in both Rate and PMP forms). Angular scanning is
      typically 6.4 minutes per 360 degree scan but is often changed.
      Experiment Bit Rate is 600 bits per second. Electrons measured
      up to 0.5 MEV. minimum sample time is 0.4 sec.
 
      FAR ENCOUNTER STOW
      ------------------
      Data Path Type                   : UNK
      Instrument Power Consumption     : 4.725000
 
      This mode includes the Full Far Encounter Mode configuration
      with the exception that the angular scanning is halted so that
      the detectors are fixed looking into a non-standard direction.
      This direction is such that the detectors peek around a sun
      screen (which covers the sector 8 position of the scan plane)
      having the effect of protecting the low energy ion and
      electron detectors by reducing their geometric factors. For
      the one application of this mode the geometric factor was
      reduced by a factor of 26 for the low energy ions (Alpha
      detector) and by an as yet uncalibrated factor for the
      electrons (Beta and Gamma detectors).
 
      NEAR ENCOUNTER
      --------------
      Data Path Type                 : UNK
      Instrument Power Consumption   : 4.525000
 
      Sometimes used at the closest-in positions during a planetary
      encounter. The high intensity detectors are turned on (A, B,
      DELTA, DELTA PRIME). (Affected channels are documented in the
      detailed level catalog.) Particle Multiple Parameter (PMP)
      composition discrimination capabilities are turned off
      (including the rate channels derived from the multiple para-
      meter information). All data appears in rate (counts/second)
      form. Angular scanning is typically 6.4 minutes per 360
      degrees scan but is often changed. Scanning cyclics driven by
      the spacecraft computer are included. Experiment Bit Rate is
      600 bits per second. Electrons are measured up to greater than
      10 MEV. Minimum sample time is 0.4 sec.
 
      URANUS SCAN CYCLIC
      ------------------
      Data Path Type                   : UNK
      Instrument Power Consumption     : 4.725000
 
      Data accumulated as with the Far Encounter Mode. Angular
      scanning controlled by spacecraft. Two quick full angular
      scans are obtained using 6 second scanning and lasting for 96
      seconds total. In between these scan periods the sensors are
      held fixed looking in sector 7. The scan periods occur every
      12 minutes.
 
      Instrument Mounting
      ===================
      LECP Instrument is mounted on the science boom about half way
      between the boom&apos;s spacecraft anchor point and imaging scan
      platform. The mounting is such that the 360 degree scan plane
      of the LECP scanning head (not to be confused with the
      scanning of the imaging instruments) is coplanar with the
      spacecraft&apos;s roll axis. Also, on the Canopus star lock the
      LECP scan plane is about 30 degrees rotated away from the
      ecliptic plane. A line passing between sectors 1 and 8, and
      between sectors 4 and 5, is parallel to the spacecraft roll
      axis. Sectors 1 and 8 point in the general direction or earth,
      and with the Canopus lock, sector 3 points generally in the
      retrograde direction (referring to the direction with respect
      to the directions of motion of the orbiting planets) and about
      30 degrees north of the ecliptic.

      Instrument Overview
      ===================
      The low energy charged particle experiment employs a set of
      many solid state detectors arranged to characterize, with
      various levels of energy, directional, and compositional
      discriminations, the in-situ charged particle environment of
      the spacecraft, both within interplanetary and planetary
      magnetospheric regions. Electrons can be characterized, with
      various electron rate energy channels, between 22 keV and
      greater than 10 meV (mode dependent). Ions, without mass
      species discriminations, can be characterized with various ion
      rate energy channels between 28 keV and greater than 152 keV
      (mode dependent). Rate data is telemetered as simple counts
      per accumulation time period. The different channels
      correspond to different onboard energy discrimination windows
      (for ions the discrimination values are mass species
      dependent, leading to some ambiguity). Above about 200
      keV/nucleon, the ions can be discriminated as to their mass
      species composition by the use of multiple parameter
      measurements. These measurements consist of the energies that
      individual particles deposit in more than one detector. This
      information is telemetered both as ion rate data, obtained by
      on-board species identification circuitry (with various
      channels representing various energy-species combinations),
      and as particle multiple parameters data, consisting of pulse-
      height-analysis values from each of the affected particle
      detectors for each analyzed particle. (A maximum of about 2 to
      5 particles per second can be analyzed in this fashion due to
      telemetry limitations. A priority scheme avoids saturation by
      one species group. there are three such groups defined: atomic
      number z = 1,2 each group in a rotating fashion.) Angular
      information is obtained through mechanical rotation of the
      detectors. The main detectors look within a single scan plane
      that is rotated 360 degrees, stopping at 8 different look
      sectors (one of the sectors is blocked to obtain a background
      measurement: sector 8). The lower energy detectors have full
      width viewcones of about 45 degrees. The scan plane is
      oriented such that a line that passes exactly between sectors
      8 and 1, and also exactly between sectors 4 and 5, is exactly
      parallel to the roll axis of the spacecraft (which nominally
      points at earth). When the roll orientation of the spacecraft
      is such that the star sensor is locked on canopus, the scan
      plane is tilted about 30 degrees out of the ecliptic plane,
      with sector 3 tilting towards north ecliptic (and also in the
      direction that is retrograde with respect to the planetary
      orbits). Sectors 1 and 8 point in the general direction of
      earth. The scan rate is variable between 48 seconds to 48
      minutes per 360 degree scan. There are some electron detectors
      (whose properties are not as well established as the others)
      that view out of the scan plane described here (see
      [KRIMIGISETAL1977]). Some of the data is subject to
      substantial contamination depending on the region under
      consideration. Before the data from this instrument can be
      used, it is vital that the contamination descriptions be
      examined (&apos;CONTAMINATION_ DESC&apos;) for each contamination type
      (&apos;CONTAMINATION_ID&apos;) and that the contaminations levels be
      determined (&apos;DATA_QUALITY_ID&apos; AND &apos;DATA_QUALITY_DESC&apos;). While
      sector 8 is the background sector for most (and generally the
      most used) data channels, sector 4 is the background sector
      for some channels. Of those channels documented in this
      catalog, sector 4 is the background sector for channels: ESA0,
      ESB0, AB10, AB12, AB13, PSA1, PSA2, PSA3, PSB1, PSB2, and PSB3.
 
      Science Objectives
      ==================
      Characterize the energy spectra, angular distributions,
      species composition, spatial structures, and temporal
      variations of the hot plasmas, energetic particles, and
      particulate radiation that exist in the vicinity of the outer
      planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) and within the
      interplanetary environment. To study the mechanisms by which
      such particles are energized and transported throughout such
      systems. To study in particular the energization and transport
      processes associated with hot plasmas and particulate
      radiation in the vicinity of planetary bow shocks,
      magnetopauses, magnetotail plasma sheets, inner radiation
      zones, the auroral zones, etc., and to study the interaction
      of such media with planetary satellites and the planetary
      atmospheres and ionospheres.
 
      Operational Considerations
      ==========================
      Instrument operates continuously sampling data over uniform
      accumulation intervals. The accumulation intervals are
      different for the different channels of information (almost
      100 channels). The scan head of the LECP Instrument usually
      scans back-and-forth continuously (forward by 315 degrees and
      then back by 315 degrees). The scanning head pauses at 8
      different scan sectors for periods ranging between 6 seconds
      and 48 seconds (for the encounter time periods) and takes
      about 0.5 seconds to scan between the sectors. Specially
      scanning modes for Voyager 2 at Uranus and Neptune have been
      developed whereby 1 or 2 quick scans are performed followed by
      6 to 12 minutes of no scanning. Also, for Voyager 2 at Jupiter
      there was an extended period of no scanning. The roll
      orientation of the spacecraft is of crucial importance as to
      the type of data returned since that orientation determines
      the orientation of the scan plane of the LECP Instrument. That
      orientation also has safety consequences since a poor
      orientation could expose the LECP detectors to ring
      particulate damage.
 
      Calibration
      ===========
      The instrument was calibrated on the ground by placing it into
      beam chambers (e.g. Van DeGraf machines) and firing calibrated
      beams of known composition at it. Also, a radioactive source
      is positioned behind the &apos;sunshield&apos; positioned at sector 8
      for in-flight calibration of some detector-electronic gains.
      Also, the instrument has a calibration mode whereby pulses of
      known strength are sent into the pre-amplifier chains
      following the detectors. Information about calibration can be
      found in: [KRIMIGSETAL1977], [KRIMIGISETAL1981],
      [ARMSTRONGETAL1981], and [HAMILTONETAL1981].

      The LECP Instrument consists of a variety (about 28) of &apos;Solid
      State Detectors&apos; that are used individually and in
      combinations (using coincidence and anti-coincidence
      criterion) to detect and characterize nuclear particles. The
      detector thicknesses range from 2 to 2450 microns to cover a
      very broad range of particle energy and mass characteristic.
 
      Detectors count particles that have appropriate discriminated
      characteristics with an efficiency that approaches 1.
      Therefore the sensitivity is strictly a function of the
      geometric factors of the detectors (geometric factors
      associated with different data channels are documented
      elsewhere in this catalog) and the energy and species band-
      widths of the data channels (also documented elsewhere). The
      geometric factors have units of area X Steradians (CM^2 X
      STR).

      Sampling Parameter Unit        : ATOMIC NUMBER
 
      A set of measured parameters which yield multiple pieces of
      information about each particle (generally ions) that Q enters
      the system. These pieces of information can, for example,
      consist of the energy deposited by a single particle in two or
      more separate detectors, or the time-of-flight between two
      different detectors plus the energy deposited in a third, etc..
      The multiple pieces of information can be used to perform mass,
      atomic number, and/or charge state discriminations on ions. The
      information can be discriminated on-board and telemetered in
      the form of ion rate channels, or the multiple information
      about each particle analyzed can be telemetered for obtaining
      the finest species discriminations.

      &apos;LECP&apos; Detector Operational Modes
      =================================
 
      FAR ENCOUNTER
      -------------
      Data Path Type                 : UNK
      Instrument Power Consumption   : 4.725000
 
      Used in the vicinity of planetary encounters. High intensity
      detectors turned off (A, B, DELTA, DELTA PRIME). (Affected
      channels are documented in detailed level catalog.) Bit Rate
      allocated 1/3 for Particle Multiple Parameters (PMP) data, also
      called Pulse Height Analysis data, and 2/3 for Rate data
      (counts/second). Full composition discrimination capabilities
      enabled (in both Rate and PMP forms). Angular scanning is
      typically 6.4 minutes per 360 degree scan but is often changed.
      Experiment Bit Rate is 600 bits per second. Electrons measured
      up to 0.5 MEV. minimum sample time is 0.4 sec.
 
      FAR ENCOUNTER STOW
      ------------------
      Data Path Type                   : UNK
      Instrument Power Consumption     : 4.725000
 
      This mode includes the Full Far Encounter Mode configuration
      with the exception that the angular scanning is halted so that
      the detectors are fixed looking into a non-standard direction.
      This direction is such that the detectors peek around a sun
      screen (which covers the sector 8 position of the scan plane)
      having the effect of protecting the low energy ion and
      electron detectors by reducing their geometric factors. For
      the one application of this mode the geometric factor was
      reduced by a factor of 26 for the low energy ions (Alpha
      detector) and by an as yet uncalibrated factor for the
      electrons (Beta and Gamma detectors).
 
      NEAR ENCOUNTER
      --------------
      Data Path Type                 : UNK
      Instrument Power Consumption   : 4.525000
 
      Sometimes used at the closest-in positions during a planetary
      encounter. The high intensity detectors are turned on (A, B,
      DELTA, DELTA PRIME). (Affected channels are documented in the
      detailed level catalog.) Particle Multiple Parameter (PMP)
      composition discrimination capabilities are turned off
      (including the rate channels derived from the multiple para-
      meter information). All data appears in rate (counts/second)
      form. Angular scanning is typically 6.4 minutes per 360
      degrees scan but is often changed. Scanning cyclics driven by
      the spacecraft computer are included. Experiment Bit Rate is
      600 bits per second. Electrons are measured up to greater than
      10 MEV. Minimum sample time is 0.4 sec.
 
      URANUS SCAN CYCLIC
      ------------------
      Data Path Type                   : UNK
      Instrument Power Consumption     : 4.725000
 
      Data accumulated as with the Far Encounter Mode. Angular
      scanning controlled by spacecraft. Two quick full angular
      scans are obtained using 6 second scanning and lasting for 96
      seconds total. In between these scan periods the sensors are
      held fixed looking in sector 7. The scan periods occur every
      12 minutes.
 
      Instrument Mounting
      ===================
      LECP Instrument is mounted on the science boom about half way
      between the boom&apos;s spacecraft anchor point and imaging scan
      platform. The mounting is such that the 360 degree scan plane
      of the LECP scanning head (not to be confused with the
      scanning of the imaging instruments) is coplanar with the
      spacecraft&apos;s roll axis. Also, on the Canopus star lock the
      LECP scan plane is about 30 degrees rotated away from the
      ecliptic plane. A line passing between sectors 1 and 8, and
      between sectors 4 and 5, is parallel to the spacecraft roll
      axis. Sectors 1 and 8 point in the general direction or earth,
      and with the Canopus lock, sector 3 points generally in the
      retrograde direction (referring to the direction with respect
      to the directions of motion of the orbiting planets) and about
      30 degrees north of the ecliptic.

            The aggregation of spacecraft sensors on the Voyager 1 spacecraft.
                                               
            The Voyager 1 spacecraft was built by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).          
            Its mass was 815 kilograms, including its own power, propulsion, and                
            communications systems and its own science instruments.                   
            Spacecraft electrical power was supplied by Radioisotope                  
            Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) that produced about 400 watts.           
            The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS),                   
            Computer Command Subsystem (CCS), and Flight Data Subsystem               
            (FDS) managed spacecraft operations.  Thrusters and gyroscopes                
            provided physical propulsion and attitude control.                        
            Communications between the spacecraft and Earth were carried              
            out via a high-gain radio antenna using both S-band and X-band            
            frequencies at data rates as high as 115.2 kilobits per second.           
            A Digital Tape Recorder (DTR) could save up to 500 million bits           
            when no Earth station was available for real-time data                    
            transmission.  Voyager control systems could record sets of               
            several thousand instructions, allowing autonomous operation              
            for days or weeks at a time.  Many of the systems were equipped
            with sensors, which fed engineering data to the ground where
            status and performance could be monitored.
            
            The spacecraft itself was built around its &apos;bus&apos; -- a decagonal           
            prism, which was about 2 meters in diameter and about 60 cm               
            deep.  Each of the ten sides of the bus was associated with a             
            &apos;bay&apos; containing engineering systems or science instrument                
            electronics.  Bay 1, for example, contained the radio                     
            transmitter.  The High-Gain Antenna (HGA) was mounted to the              
            end of the bus facing Earth.  The bays were numbered 1 through            
            10 in a clockwise direction when viewed from Earth.  Extending            
            away from the bus were three booms: a science boom and scan               
            platform to which most instruments were mounted, a magnetometer           
            boom, and a boom to which the RTGs were mounted.                          
            
            Spacecraft Coordinate System                                              
            ----------------------------                                              
            The centerline of the bus was the roll axis of the                      
            spacecraft; it also served as the z-axis of the spacecraft              
            coordinate system with the high-gain antenna (HGA) boresight            
            defining the negative z-direction.  The HGA boresight was               
            also defined as cone angle 0 degrees and as azimuth 180                 
            degrees, elevation 7 degrees.  The science boom, supporting             
            the scan platform, extended in the general direction of                 
            positive y; this boom was also defined as being at cone angle           
            90 degrees, clock angle 215 degrees and at azimuth 180                  
            degrees, elevation 97 degrees.  The boom supporting the RTGs              
            was mounted on the bus in generally the negative y direction.           
            The positive y-axis (yaw axis) of the spacecraft coordinate             
            system passed through Bay 3; the negative y-axis passed                 
            through Bay 8.  The x-axis (pitch axis) was in a direction              
            which defined a right-handed rectangular coordinate system.             
            The positive x-axis was at cone angle 90 degrees, clock angle           
            305 degrees (azimuth 270 degrees, elevation 90 degrees).                
            
            Telecommunications Subsystem                                              
            ----------------------------                                              
            The high-gain antenna was mounted to the spacecraft bus,                
            pointing in the negative z-direction.  It was a parabolic               
            reflector 3.7 meters in diameter with a feed that permitted             
            simultaneous operation at both S-band (13 cm wavelength) and            
            X-band (3.6 cm).  The half-power full-width of the antenna              
            beam was 0.6 degrees at X-band and 2.3 degrees at S-band.               
            The Low-Gain Antenna (LGA) was mounted on the feed structure            
            of the HGA and radiated approximately uniformly over the                
            hemisphere into which the HGA pointed.                                  
            
            The Telecommunications Subsystem (TCS) electronics included a           
            redundant pair of transponders, meaning that a failed                   
            functional unit in one transponder could be bypassed by                 
            swapping to the redundant unit.  The TCS could transmit                 
            science data on the X-band link at rates between 4.8 and                
            115.2 kilobits per second and engineering data on the S-band            
            link at 40 bits per second.  It could receive instructions              
            sent (uplinked) from ground stations at a rate of 16 bits per           
            second.  Commands were extracted from the uplink signal by              
            the Command Detector Unit (CDU) and were then sent to the               
            Computer Command Subsystem (CCS).                                       
            
            Spacecraft receivers were designed to lock to the uplink                
            signal.  Without locking, Doppler effects -- resulting from             
            relative motion of the spacecraft and ground station -- could           
            result in loss of the radio link as the frequency of the                
            received signal drifted.                     
            
            Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem                               
            -------------------------------------------                               
            The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS)                  
            provided three-axis-stabilized control so that the spacecraft           
            could maintain a fixed orientation in space.  Attitude                  
            control was accomplished using gyroscopes or by celestial               
            reference.  The AACS also controlled motion of the scan                 
            platform, upon which the four &apos;remote sensing&apos; instruments              
            were mounted.                                                           
            
            Gyro control was used in special situations (e.g., trajectory           
            corrections and solar conjunctions) for periods of up to                
            several days.  The inertial reference unit operated with                
            tuned rotor gyros having an uncalibrated drift rate of less             
            than 0.5 degrees per hour and a calibrated drift rate of less           
            than 0.05 degrees per hour.                                             
            
            Celestial control was based on viewing the Sun (through a               
            sensor mounted on the high-gain antenna) and a single bright            
            star (through a second sensor named the Canopus Star Tracker,           
            after the star used most frequently as the reference).  When            
            the spacecraft attitude drifted by more than a small amount             
            from the reference objects, the AACS fired small thrusters              
            which returned the spacecraft to the proper orientation.  The           
            Sun sensor was an optical potentiometer with a cadmium                  
            sulfide detector; its error was less than 0.01 degrees and              
            its limit cycle was +/-0.05 degrees.  The Canopus Star                  
            Tracker was an image dissector tube with a cesium detector,             
            an error of less than 0.01 degree, and a limit cycle of                 
            +/-0.05 degrees.                                                        
            
            Redundant (backup) sun sensors, star trackers, and computers            
            were also part of the AACS.  The non-redundant portions of              
            the AACS were those controlling the pointing of the                     
            instrument scan platform, which had two degrees of freedom --           
            elevation and azimuth (see below).
            
            Propulsion Subsystem                                                      
            --------------------                                                      
            The propulsion system was part of the AACS and consisted of             
            16 hydrazine thrusters.  These thrusters were also used to              
            control the three-axis stabilization of the spacecraft.  Two            
            thrusters on opposite sides of the spacecraft were used to              
            perform positive roll turns around the +Z axis.  Two                    
            oppositely pointed thrusters were used to perform negative              
            roll turns.  One thruster was used to perform positive yaw              
            turns (around the +Y axis) and one was used to perform                  
            negative yaw turns.  One thruster was used to perform                   
            positive pitch turns (around the +X axis) and one was used to           
            perform negative pitch turns.  A backup hydrazine system was            
            connected to a redundant set of eight thrusters.                        
            
            Power Subsystem                                                           
            ---------------                                                           
            Spacecraft power was provided by three Radioisotope                     
            Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) mounted on a boom in the               
            negative y-direction.  At Launch the three RTGs converted               
            7000 watts of heat into 475 watts of electrical power.  RTG             
            electrical output decreased by about 7 watts per year because           
            of decay of the plutonium dioxide fissionable material and              
            degradation of the silicon-germanium thermocouples.  The                
            difference between available electrical power and the power             
            required to operate spacecraft subsystems was called the                
            &apos;power margin.&apos; Voyager Project guidelines required a power             
            margin of at least 12 watts to guard against electrical                 
            transients and miscalculations; excess electrical power was             
            dissipated as heat in a shunt radiator.                                 
            
            Data Storage Subsystem                                                    
            ----------------------                                                    
            The Digital Tape Recorder (DTR) was used to store data when             
            real-time communications with Earth were either not possible            
            or not scheduled.  The DTR recorded data on eight tracks;               
            rates were 115.2 kilobits per second (record only), 21.6                
            kilobits per second (playback only), and 7.2 kilobits per               
            second (record and playback).  Capacity of each track was 12            
            images or equivalent.                                                   
            
            Computer Command Subsystem                                                
            --------------------------                                                
            The Computer Command Subsystem (CCS) consisted of two                   
            identical computer processors, their software algorithms, and           
            associated electronic hardware.  The CCS was the central                
            controller of the spacecraft.  During most of the Voyager               
            mission the two CCS computers on each spacecraft were used              
            non-redundantly to increase the command and processing                  
            capability of the spacecraft.                                           
            
            Flight Data Subsystem                                                     
            ---------------------                                                     
            The Flight Data Subsystem (FDS) consisted of two                        
            reprogrammable digital computers and associated encoding                
            hardware.  The FDS collected and formatted science and                  
            engineering telemetry data for transmission to Earth.                   
            Convolutional coding was imposed on all data transmitted from           
            the spacecraft.  Additionally, both Golay encoding and Reed-            
            Solomon encoding were available for use on spacecraft data.             
            Data compression was also performed within the FDS.                     
            
            Science Boom                                                              
            ------------                                                              
            The Voyager science instrument boom carried the plasma                  
            detector, cosmic ray detector and the low energy charged                
            particle detector.  The scan platform was mounted on the                
            science boom.                                                           
            
            Scan Platform                                                             
            -------------                                                             
            Four instruments (Imaging, PhotoPolarimeter, Infra-Red                  
            Interferometric Spectrometer, and Ultra Violet Spectrometer)            
            were mounted on the scan platform, which could be slewed by             
            motors and gears (called actuators).  Elevation of the scan             
            platform was measured with respect to a plane slightly offset           
            (by approximately 7 degrees) from the spacecraft x-z plane;             
            the spacecraft positive y-axis was at 97 degrees elevation              
            (see Spacecraft Coordinate System above).  The scan platform            
            azimuth reference was defined by the y-z plane, with zero               
            azimuth being in the negative z-direction.  Drive actuators             
            were controlled by fine feedback potentiometers; the error of           
            each was less than 0.03 degrees, and the final pointing error           
            of the scan platform was nominally +/-0.1 degrees (2-sigma              
            per axis).  Subsequent analysis by the Navigation and                   
            Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) at JPL showed larger           
            errors during at least the Jupiter and Saturn encounters.               
            High rate slews of 1 deg/sec were discontinued after the                
            azimuth drive mechanism on Voyager 2 temporarily froze a                
            short time after Saturn closest approach.  The medium slew              
            rate was 0.33 deg/sec, and the low slew rate was 0.08                   
            deg/sec.                                                                
            
            Magnetometer Boom                                                         
            -----------------                                                         
            Two low-field magnetometers were mounted on a 13-meter-long             
            boom that was unfurled and extended automatically after                 
            Launch.  One low-field magnetometer was mounted at the end of           
            the boom and a second was mounted about 3 meters from the               
            end.  Two high-field magnetometers were mounted at the base             
            of the boom.

            The aggregation of spacecraft sensors on the Voyager 1 spacecraft.
                                               
            The Voyager 1 spacecraft was built by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).          
            Its mass was 815 kilograms, including its own power, propulsion, and                
            communications systems and its own science instruments.                   
            Spacecraft electrical power was supplied by Radioisotope                  
            Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) that produced about 400 watts.           
            The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS),                   
            Computer Command Subsystem (CCS), and Flight Data Subsystem               
            (FDS) managed spacecraft operations.  Thrusters and gyroscopes                
            provided physical propulsion and attitude control.                        
            Communications between the spacecraft and Earth were carried              
            out via a high-gain radio antenna using both S-band and X-band            
            frequencies at data rates as high as 115.2 kilobits per second.           
            A Digital Tape Recorder (DTR) could save up to 500 million bits           
            when no Earth station was available for real-time data                    
            transmission.  Voyager control systems could record sets of               
            several thousand instructions, allowing autonomous operation              
            for days or weeks at a time.  Many of the systems were equipped
            with sensors, which fed engineering data to the ground where
            status and performance could be monitored.
            
            The spacecraft itself was built around its &apos;bus&apos; -- a decagonal           
            prism, which was about 2 meters in diameter and about 60 cm               
            deep.  Each of the ten sides of the bus was associated with a             
            &apos;bay&apos; containing engineering systems or science instrument                
            electronics.  Bay 1, for example, contained the radio                     
            transmitter.  The High-Gain Antenna (HGA) was mounted to the              
            end of the bus facing Earth.  The bays were numbered 1 through            
            10 in a clockwise direction when viewed from Earth.  Extending            
            away from the bus were three booms: a science boom and scan               
            platform to which most instruments were mounted, a magnetometer           
            boom, and a boom to which the RTGs were mounted.                          
            
            Spacecraft Coordinate System                                              
            ----------------------------                                              
            The centerline of the bus was the roll axis of the                      
            spacecraft; it also served as the z-axis of the spacecraft              
            coordinate system with the high-gain antenna (HGA) boresight            
            defining the negative z-direction.  The HGA boresight was               
            also defined as cone angle 0 degrees and as azimuth 180                 
            degrees, elevation 7 degrees.  The science boom, supporting             
            the scan platform, extended in the general direction of                 
            positive y; this boom was also defined as being at cone angle           
            90 degrees, clock angle 215 degrees and at azimuth 180                  
            degrees, elevation 97 degrees.  The boom supporting the RTGs              
            was mounted on the bus in generally the negative y direction.           
            The positive y-axis (yaw axis) of the spacecraft coordinate             
            system passed through Bay 3; the negative y-axis passed                 
            through Bay 8.  The x-axis (pitch axis) was in a direction              
            which defined a right-handed rectangular coordinate system.             
            The positive x-axis was at cone angle 90 degrees, clock angle           
            305 degrees (azimuth 270 degrees, elevation 90 degrees).                
            
            Telecommunications Subsystem                                              
            ----------------------------                                              
            The high-gain antenna was mounted to the spacecraft bus,                
            pointing in the negative z-direction.  It was a parabolic               
            reflector 3.7 meters in diameter with a feed that permitted             
            simultaneous operation at both S-band (13 cm wavelength) and            
            X-band (3.6 cm).  The half-power full-width of the antenna              
            beam was 0.6 degrees at X-band and 2.3 degrees at S-band.               
            The Low-Gain Antenna (LGA) was mounted on the feed structure            
            of the HGA and radiated approximately uniformly over the                
            hemisphere into which the HGA pointed.                                  
            
            The Telecommunications Subsystem (TCS) electronics included a           
            redundant pair of transponders, meaning that a failed                   
            functional unit in one transponder could be bypassed by                 
            swapping to the redundant unit.  The TCS could transmit                 
            science data on the X-band link at rates between 4.8 and                
            115.2 kilobits per second and engineering data on the S-band            
            link at 40 bits per second.  It could receive instructions              
            sent (uplinked) from ground stations at a rate of 16 bits per           
            second.  Commands were extracted from the uplink signal by              
            the Command Detector Unit (CDU) and were then sent to the               
            Computer Command Subsystem (CCS).                                       
            
            Spacecraft receivers were designed to lock to the uplink                
            signal.  Without locking, Doppler effects -- resulting from             
            relative motion of the spacecraft and ground station -- could           
            result in loss of the radio link as the frequency of the                
            received signal drifted.                     
            
            Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem                               
            -------------------------------------------                               
            The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS)                  
            provided three-axis-stabilized control so that the spacecraft           
            could maintain a fixed orientation in space.  Attitude                  
            control was accomplished using gyroscopes or by celestial               
            reference.  The AACS also controlled motion of the scan                 
            platform, upon which the four &apos;remote sensing&apos; instruments              
            were mounted.                                                           
            
            Gyro control was used in special situations (e.g., trajectory           
            corrections and solar conjunctions) for periods of up to                
            several days.  The inertial reference unit operated with                
            tuned rotor gyros having an uncalibrated drift rate of less             
            than 0.5 degrees per hour and a calibrated drift rate of less           
            than 0.05 degrees per hour.                                             
            
            Celestial control was based on viewing the Sun (through a               
            sensor mounted on the high-gain antenna) and a single bright            
            star (through a second sensor named the Canopus Star Tracker,           
            after the star used most frequently as the reference).  When            
            the spacecraft attitude drifted by more than a small amount             
            from the reference objects, the AACS fired small thrusters              
            which returned the spacecraft to the proper orientation.  The           
            Sun sensor was an optical potentiometer with a cadmium                  
            sulfide detector; its error was less than 0.01 degrees and              
            its limit cycle was +/-0.05 degrees.  The Canopus Star                  
            Tracker was an image dissector tube with a cesium detector,             
            an error of less than 0.01 degree, and a limit cycle of                 
            +/-0.05 degrees.                                                        
            
            Redundant (backup) sun sensors, star trackers, and computers            
            were also part of the AACS.  The non-redundant portions of              
            the AACS were those controlling the pointing of the                     
            instrument scan platform, which had two degrees of freedom --           
            elevation and azimuth (see below).
            
            Propulsion Subsystem                                                      
            --------------------                                                      
            The propulsion system was part of the AACS and consisted of             
            16 hydrazine thrusters.  These thrusters were also used to              
            control the three-axis stabilization of the spacecraft.  Two            
            thrusters on opposite sides of the spacecraft were used to              
            perform positive roll turns around the +Z axis.  Two                    
            oppositely pointed thrusters were used to perform negative              
            roll turns.  One thruster was used to perform positive yaw              
            turns (around the +Y axis) and one was used to perform                  
            negative yaw turns.  One thruster was used to perform                   
            positive pitch turns (around the +X axis) and one was used to           
            perform negative pitch turns.  A backup hydrazine system was            
            connected to a redundant set of eight thrusters.                        
            
            Power Subsystem                                                           
            ---------------                                                           
            Spacecraft power was provided by three Radioisotope                     
            Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) mounted on a boom in the               
            negative y-direction.  At Launch the three RTGs converted               
            7000 watts of heat into 475 watts of electrical power.  RTG             
            electrical output decreased by about 7 watts per year because           
            of decay of the plutonium dioxide fissionable material and              
            degradation of the silicon-germanium thermocouples.  The                
            difference between available electrical power and the power             
            required to operate spacecraft subsystems was called the                
            &apos;power margin.&apos; Voyager Project guidelines required a power             
            margin of at least 12 watts to guard against electrical                 
            transients and miscalculations; excess electrical power was             
            dissipated as heat in a shunt radiator.                                 
            
            Data Storage Subsystem                                                    
            ----------------------                                                    
            The Digital Tape Recorder (DTR) was used to store data when             
            real-time communications with Earth were either not possible            
            or not scheduled.  The DTR recorded data on eight tracks;               
            rates were 115.2 kilobits per second (record only), 21.6                
            kilobits per second (playback only), and 7.2 kilobits per               
            second (record and playback).  Capacity of each track was 12            
            images or equivalent.                                                   
            
            Computer Command Subsystem                                                
            --------------------------                                                
            The Computer Command Subsystem (CCS) consisted of two                   
            identical computer processors, their software algorithms, and           
            associated electronic hardware.  The CCS was the central                
            controller of the spacecraft.  During most of the Voyager               
            mission the two CCS computers on each spacecraft were used              
            non-redundantly to increase the command and processing                  
            capability of the spacecraft.                                           
            
            Flight Data Subsystem                                                     
            ---------------------                                                     
            The Flight Data Subsystem (FDS) consisted of two                        
            reprogrammable digital computers and associated encoding                
            hardware.  The FDS collected and formatted science and                  
            engineering telemetry data for transmission to Earth.                   
            Convolutional coding was imposed on all data transmitted from           
            the spacecraft.  Additionally, both Golay encoding and Reed-            
            Solomon encoding were available for use on spacecraft data.             
            Data compression was also performed within the FDS.

            The Voyager science instrument boom carried the plasma                  
            detector, cosmic ray detector and the low energy charged                
            particle detector.  The scan platform was mounted on the                
            science boom.                                                           
            
            Scan Platform                                                             
            -------------                                                             
            Four instruments (Imaging, PhotoPolarimeter, Infra-Red                  
            Interferometric Spectrometer, and Ultra Violet Spectrometer)            
            were mounted on the scan platform, which could be slewed by             
            motors and gears (called actuators).  Elevation of the scan             
            platform was measured with respect to a plane slightly offset           
            (by approximately 7 degrees) from the spacecraft x-z plane;             
            the spacecraft positive y-axis was at 97 degrees elevation              
            (see Spacecraft Coordinate System above).  The scan platform            
            azimuth reference was defined by the y-z plane, with zero               
            azimuth being in the negative z-direction.  Drive actuators             
            were controlled by fine feedback potentiometers; the error of           
            each was less than 0.03 degrees, and the final pointing error           
            of the scan platform was nominally +/-0.1 degrees (2-sigma              
            per axis).  Subsequent analysis by the Navigation and                   
            Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) at JPL showed larger           
            errors during at least the Jupiter and Saturn encounters.               
            High rate slews of 1 deg/sec were discontinued after the                
            azimuth drive mechanism on Voyager 2 temporarily froze a                
            short time after Saturn closest approach.  The medium slew              
            rate was 0.33 deg/sec, and the low slew rate was 0.08                   
            deg/sec.

  Instrument Host Overview
  ========================
    For most Voyager experiments, data were collected by
    instruments on the spacecraft.  Those data were then relayed
    via the telemetry system to stations of the NASA Deep Space
    Network (DSN) on Earth.  Radio Science experiments (such as
    radio occultations) required that DSN hardware also participate
    in data acquisition.  The following sections provide an
    overview first of the spacecraft and then of the DSN ground
    system as both supported Voyager science activities.
 
 
  Instrument Host Overview - Spacecraft
  =====================================
    The Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft were identical and were
    built by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).  With a mass of
    815 kilograms, each carried its own power, propulsion, and
    communications systems and its own science instruments.
    Spacecraft electrical power was supplied by Radioisotope
    Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) that produced about 400 watts.
    The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS),
    Computer Command Subsystem (CCS), and Flight Data Subsystem
    (FDS) managed spacecraft operations.  Thrusters and gyros
    provided physical propulsion and attitude control.
    Communications between the spacecraft and Earth were carried
    out via a high-gain radio antenna using both S-band and X-band
    frequencies at data rates as high as 115.2 kilobits per second.
    A Digital Tape Recorder (DTR) could save up to 500 million bits
    when no Earth station was available for real-time data
    transmission.  Voyager control systems could record sets of
    several thousand instructions, allowing autonomous operation
    for days or weeks at a time.  More information on the
    spacecraft can be found in [MORRISON1982], [KOHLHASE1989], and
    [JPLPD618-128].
 
    The spacecraft itself was built around its &apos;bus&apos; -- a decagonal
    prism, which was about 2 meters in diameter and about 60 cm
    deep.  Each of the ten sides of the bus was associated with a
    &apos;bay&apos; containing engineering systems or science instrument
    electronics.  Bay 1, for example, contained the radio
    transmitter.  The High-Gain Antenna (HGA) was mounted to the
    end of the bus facing Earth.  The bays were numbered 1 through
    10 in a clockwise direction when viewed from Earth.  Extending
    away from the bus were three booms: a science boom and scan
    platform to which most instruments were mounted, a magnetometer
    boom, and a boom to which the RTGs were mounted.
 
 
    Spacecraft Coordinate System
    ----------------------------
      The centerline of the bus was the roll axis of the
      spacecraft; it also served as the z-axis of the spacecraft
      coordinate system with the high-gain antenna (HGA) boresight
      defining the negative z-direction.  The HGA boresight was
      also defined as cone angle 0 degrees and as azimuth 180
      degrees, elevation 7 degrees.  The science boom, supporting
      the scan platform, extended in the general direction of
      positive y; this boom was also defined as being at cone angle
      90 degrees, clock angle 215 degrees and at azimuth 180
      degrees, elevation 97 degrees.  A boom supporting the RTGs
      was mounted on the bus in generally the negative y direction.
      The positive y-axis (yaw axis) of the spacecraft coordinate
      system passed through Bay 3; the negative y-axis passed
      through Bay 8.  The x-axis (pitch axis) was in a direction
      which defined a right-handed rectangular coordinate system.
      The positive x-axis was at cone angle 90 degrees, clock angle
      305 degrees (azimuth 270 degrees, elevation 90 degrees).
 
 
    Telecommunications Subsystem
    ----------------------------
      The high-gain antenna was mounted to the spacecraft bus,
      pointing in the negative z-direction.  It was a parabolic
      reflector 3.7 meters in diameter with a feed that permitted
      simultaneous operation at both S-band (13 cm wavelength) and
      X-band (3.6 cm).  The half-power full-width of the antenna
      beam was 0.6 degrees at X-band and 2.3 degrees at S-band.
      The Low-Gain Antenna (LGA) was mounted on the feed structure
      of the HGA and radiated approximately uniformly over the
      hemisphere into which the HGA pointed.
 
      The Telecommunications Subsystem (TCS) electronics included a
      redundant pair of transponders, meaning that a failed
      functional unit in one transponder could be bypassed by
      swapping to the redundant unit.  The TCS could transmit
      science data on the X-band link at rates between 4.8 and
      115.2 kilobits per second and engineering data on the S-band
      link at 40 bits per second.  It could receive instructions
      sent (uplinked) from ground stations at a rate of 16 bits per
      second.  Commands were extracted from the uplink signal by
      the Command Detector Unit (CDU) and were then sent to the
      Computer Command Subsystem (CCS).
 
      Spacecraft receivers were designed to lock to the uplink
      signal.  Without locking, Doppler effects -- resulting from
      relative motion of the spacecraft and ground station -- could
      result in loss of the radio link as the frequency of the
      received signal drifted.
 
 
    Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem
    -------------------------------------------
      The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS)
      provided three-axis-stabilized control so that the spacecraft
      could maintain a fixed orientation in space.  Attitude
      control was accomplished using gyroscopes or by celestial
      reference.  The AACS also controlled motion of the scan
      platform, upon which the four &apos;remote sensing&apos; instruments
      were mounted.
 
      Gyro control was used in special situations (e.g., trajectory
      corrections and solar conjunctions) for periods of up to
      several days.  The inertial reference unit operated with
      tuned rotor gyros having an uncalibrated drift rate of less
      than 0.5 degrees per hour and a calibrated drift rate of less
      than 0.05 degrees per hour.
 
      Celestial control was based on viewing the Sun (through a
      sensor mounted on the high-gain antenna) and a single bright
      star (through a second sensor named the Canopus Star Tracker,
      after the star used most frequently as the reference).  When
      the spacecraft attitude drifted by more than a small amount
      from the reference objects, the AACS fired small thrusters
      which returned the spacecraft to the proper orientation.  The
      Sun sensor was an optical potentiometer with a cadmium
      sulfide detector; its error was less than 0.01 degrees and
      its limit cycle was +/-0.05 degrees.  The Canopus Star
      Tracker was an image dissector tube with a cesium detector,
      an error of less than 0.01 degree, and a limit cycle of
      +/-0.05 degrees.
 
      Redundant (backup) sun sensors, star trackers, and computers
      were also part of the AACS.  The non-redundant portions of
      the AACS were those controlling the pointing of the
      instrument scan platform, which had two degrees of freedom --
      elevation and azimuth (see below).
 
 
    Propulsion Subsystem
    --------------------
      The propulsion system was part of the AACS and consisted of
      16 hydrazine thrusters.  These thrusters were also used to
      control the three-axis stabilization of the spacecraft.  Two
      thrusters on opposite sides of the spacecraft were used to
      perform positive roll turns around the +Z axis.  Two
      oppositely pointed thrusters were used to perform negative
      roll turns.  One thruster was used to perform positive yaw
      turns (around the +Y axis) and one was used to perform
      negative yaw turns.  One thruster was used to perform
      positive pitch turns (around the +X axis) and one was used to
      perform negative pitch turns.  A backup hydrazine system was
      connected to a redundant set of eight thrusters.
 
 
    Power Subsystem
    ---------------
      Spacecraft power was provided by three Radioisotope
      Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) mounted on a boom in the
      negative y-direction.  At Launch the three RTGs converted
      7000 watts of heat into 475 watts of electrical power.  RTG
      electrical output decreased by about 7 watts per year because
      of decay of the plutonium dioxide fissionable material and
      degradation of the silicon-germanium thermocouples.  The
      difference between available electrical power and the power
      required to operate spacecraft subsystems was called the
      &apos;power margin.&apos; Voyager Project guidelines required a power
      margin of at least 12 watts to guard against electrical
      transients and miscalculations; excess electrical power was
      dissipated as heat in a shunt radiator.
 
 
    Data Storage Subsystem
    ----------------------
      The Digital Tape Recorder (DTR) was used to store data when
      real-time communications with Earth were either not possible
      or not scheduled.  The DTR recorded data on eight tracks;
      rates were 115.2 kilobits per second (record only), 21.6
      kilobits per second (playback only), and 7.2 kilobits per
      second (record and playback).  Capacity of each track was 12
      images or equivalent.
 
 
    Computer Command Subsystem
    --------------------------
      The Computer Command Subsystem (CCS) consisted of two
      identical computer processors, their software algorithms, and
      associated electronic hardware.  The CCS was the central
      controller of the spacecraft.  During most of the Voyager
      mission the two CCS computers on each spacecraft were used
      non-redundantly to increase the command and processing
      capability of the spacecraft.
 
 
    Flight Data Subsystem
    ---------------------
      The Flight Data Subsystem (FDS) consisted of two
      reprogrammable digital computers and associated encoding
      hardware.  The FDS collected and formatted science and
      engineering telemetry data for transmission to Earth.
      Convolutional coding was imposed on all data transmitted from
      the spacecraft.  Additionally, both Golay encoding and Reed-
      Solomon encoding were available for use on spacecraft data.
      Data compression was also performed within the FDS.
 
 
    Science Boom
    ------------
      The Voyager science instrument boom carried the plasma
      detector, cosmic ray detector and the low energy charged
      particle detector.  The scan platform was mounted on the
      science boom.
 
 
    Scan Platform
    -------------
      Four instruments (Imaging, PhotoPolarimeter, Infra-Red
      Interferometric Spectrometer, and Ultra Violet Spectrometer)
      were mounted on the scan platform, which could be slewed by
      motors and gears (called actuators).  Elevation of the scan
      platform was measured with respect to a plane slightly offset
      (by approximately 7 degrees) from the spacecraft x-z plane;
      the spacecraft positive y-axis was at 97 degrees elevation
      (see Spacecraft Coordinate System above).  The scan platform
      azimuth reference was defined by the y-z plane, with zero
      azimuth being in the negative z-direction.  Drive actuators
      were controlled by fine feedback potentiometers; the error of
      each was less than 0.03 degrees, and the final pointing error
      of the scan platform was nominally +/-0.1 degrees (2-sigma
      per axis).  Subsequent analysis by the Navigation and
      Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) at JPL has shown larger
      errors during at least the Jupiter and Saturn encounters.
      High rate slews were at 1 deg/sec, medium rate slews were at
      0.33 deg/sec, and low rate slews were at 0.08 deg/sec.
 
 
    Magnetometer Boom
    -----------------
      Two low-field magnetometers were mounted on a 13-meter-long
      boom that was unfurled and extended automatically after
      Launch.  One low-field magnetometer was mounted at the end of
      the boom and a second was mounted about 3 meters from the
      end.  Two high-field magnetometers were mounted at the base
      of the boom.
 
 
    Science Sensors
    ---------------
      Each Voyager spacecraft carried instrumentation to support
      eleven science investigations.  Target body (or remote
      sensing) instruments included:
 
      (1) Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS)
      (2) Photopolarimeter Subsystem (PPS)
      (3) Infrared Radiometer Interferometer Spectrometer (IRIS)
      (4) Ultraviolet Spectrometer (UVS)
 
      Fields, waves, and particles (or in situ) sensors included:
 
      (1) Plasma Subsystem (PLS)
      (2) Low-Energy Charged Particle (LECP)
      (3) Cosmic-Ray Subsystem (CRS)
      (4) Magnetic Fields (MAG)
      (5) Plasma Wave Subsystem (PWS)
      (6) Planetary Radio Astronomy (PRA)
 
      The Radio Science (RSS) investigation was carried out using
      the on-board and ground elements of the Telecommunications
      Subsystem (TCS).  More information on instrumentation for
      each of the science investigations can be found elsewhere.
 
 
  Instrument Host Overview - DSN
  ==============================
    Voyager Radio Science investigations utilized instrumentation
    with elements on both the spacecraft and at ground stations of
    the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN).  Much of this was shared
    equipment, used for routine telecommunications as well as for
    Radio Science.
 
    The DSN is a telecommunications facility managed by the Jet
    Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology
    for NASA.  The primary function of the DSN is to provide
    two-way communications between the Earth and spacecraft
    exploring the solar system.  To carry out this function the DSN
    is equipped with high-power transmitters, low-noise amplifiers
    and receivers, and appropriate monitoring and control systems.
 
    During the Voyager era the DSN consisted of three complexes
    situated at approximately equally spaced longitudinal intervals
    around the globe at Goldstone (near Barstow, California),
    Robledo (near Madrid, Spain), and Tidbinbilla (near Canberra,
    Australia).  Two of the complexes are located in the northern
    hemisphere while the third is in the southern hemisphere.
 
    The network comprised several subnets, each of which included
    one antenna at each complex.  The subnets were defined
    according to the properties of their respective antennas.  Over
    the course of the Voyager Mission, those antennas were expanded
    and improved.  Nominal dimensions at the end (and beginning) of
    the Voyager Mission were: 70-m diameter (initially 64-m),
    standard 34-m diameter (initially 26-m), and high-efficiency
    34-m diameter (did not exist at beginning of Voyager).
 
    Additional ground equipment was provided by the Commonwealth
    Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) in
    Australia, the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science
    (ISAS) in Japan, and the National Radio Astronomy Observatory
    (NRAO) in the United States.  For the Voyager 2 encounters with
    Uranus and Neptune, the CSIRO 64-m diameter radio astronomy
    antenna near Parkes (Australia) was included in the receiving
    system for both telemetry and Radio Science.  For the Voyager 2
    encounter with Neptune, the ISAS 64-m diameter antenna near
    Usuda (Japan) was added for Radio Science and the NRAO Very
    Large Array (VLA) near Socorro (New Mexico) was added for
    telemetry.  The VLA consisted of 27 25-m antennas.  Parkes,
    Usuda, and the VLA were integrated with the permanent stations
    at Goldstone, Robledo, and Tidbinbilla by DSN personnel.

  Instrument Host Overview
  ========================
    For most Voyager experiments, data were collected by
    instruments on the spacecraft.  Those data were then relayed
    via the telemetry system to stations of the NASA Deep Space
    Network (DSN) on Earth.  Radio Science experiments (such as
    radio occultations) required that DSN hardware also participate
    in data acquisition.  The following sections provide an
    overview first of the spacecraft and then of the DSN ground
    system as both supported Voyager science activities.
 
 
  Instrument Host Overview - Spacecraft
  =====================================
    The Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft were identical and were
    built by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).  With a mass of
    815 kilograms, each carried its own power, propulsion, and
    communications systems and its own science instruments.
    Spacecraft electrical power was supplied by Radioisotope
    Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) that produced about 400 watts.
    The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS),
    Computer Command Subsystem (CCS), and Flight Data Subsystem
    (FDS) managed spacecraft operations.  Thrusters and gyros
    provided physical propulsion and attitude control.
    Communications between the spacecraft and Earth were carried
    out via a high-gain radio antenna using both S-band and X-band
    frequencies at data rates as high as 115.2 kilobits per second.
    A Digital Tape Recorder (DTR) could save up to 500 million bits
    when no Earth station was available for real-time data
    transmission.  Voyager control systems could record sets of
    several thousand instructions, allowing autonomous operation
    for days or weeks at a time.  More information on the
    spacecraft can be found in [MORRISON1982], [KOHLHASE1989], and
    [JPLPD618-128].
 
    The spacecraft itself was built around its &apos;bus&apos; -- a decagonal
    prism, which was about 2 meters in diameter and about 60 cm
    deep.  Each of the ten sides of the bus was associated with a
    &apos;bay&apos; containing engineering systems or science instrument
    electronics.  Bay 1, for example, contained the radio
    transmitter.  The High-Gain Antenna (HGA) was mounted to the
    end of the bus facing Earth.  The bays were numbered 1 through
    10 in a clockwise direction when viewed from Earth.  Extending
    away from the bus were three booms: a science boom and scan
    platform to which most instruments were mounted, a magnetometer
    boom, and a boom to which the RTGs were mounted.
 
 
    Spacecraft Coordinate System
    ----------------------------
      The centerline of the bus was the roll axis of the
      spacecraft; it also served as the z-axis of the spacecraft
      coordinate system with the high-gain antenna (HGA) boresight
      defining the negative z-direction.  The HGA boresight was
      also defined as cone angle 0 degrees and as azimuth 180
      degrees, elevation 7 degrees.  The science boom, supporting
      the scan platform, extended in the general direction of
      positive y; this boom was also defined as being at cone angle
      90 degrees, clock angle 215 degrees and at azimuth 180
      degrees, elevation 97 degrees.  A boom supporting the RTGs
      was mounted on the bus in generally the negative y direction.
      The positive y-axis (yaw axis) of the spacecraft coordinate
      system passed through Bay 3; the negative y-axis passed
      through Bay 8.  The x-axis (pitch axis) was in a direction
      which defined a right-handed rectangular coordinate system.
      The positive x-axis was at cone angle 90 degrees, clock angle
      305 degrees (azimuth 270 degrees, elevation 90 degrees).
 
 
    Telecommunications Subsystem
    ----------------------------
      The high-gain antenna was mounted to the spacecraft bus,
      pointing in the negative z-direction.  It was a parabolic
      reflector 3.7 meters in diameter with a feed that permitted
      simultaneous operation at both S-band (13 cm wavelength) and
      X-band (3.6 cm).  The half-power full-width of the antenna
      beam was 0.6 degrees at X-band and 2.3 degrees at S-band.
      The Low-Gain Antenna (LGA) was mounted on the feed structure
      of the HGA and radiated approximately uniformly over the
      hemisphere into which the HGA pointed.
 
      The Telecommunications Subsystem (TCS) electronics included a
      redundant pair of transponders, meaning that a failed
      functional unit in one transponder could be bypassed by
      swapping to the redundant unit.  The TCS could transmit
      science data on the X-band link at rates between 4.8 and
      115.2 kilobits per second and engineering data on the S-band
      link at 40 bits per second.  It could receive instructions
      sent (uplinked) from ground stations at a rate of 16 bits per
      second.  Commands were extracted from the uplink signal by
      the Command Detector Unit (CDU) and were then sent to the
      Computer Command Subsystem (CCS).
 
      Spacecraft receivers were designed to lock to the uplink
      signal.  Without locking, Doppler effects -- resulting from
      relative motion of the spacecraft and ground station -- could
      result in loss of the radio link as the frequency of the
      received signal drifted.
 
 
    Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem
    -------------------------------------------
      The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS)
      provided three-axis-stabilized control so that the spacecraft
      could maintain a fixed orientation in space.  Attitude
      control was accomplished using gyroscopes or by celestial
      reference.  The AACS also controlled motion of the scan
      platform, upon which the four &apos;remote sensing&apos; instruments
      were mounted.
 
      Gyro control was used in special situations (e.g., trajectory
      corrections and solar conjunctions) for periods of up to
      several days.  The inertial reference unit operated with
      tuned rotor gyros having an uncalibrated drift rate of less
      than 0.5 degrees per hour and a calibrated drift rate of less
      than 0.05 degrees per hour.
 
      Celestial control was based on viewing the Sun (through a
      sensor mounted on the high-gain antenna) and a single bright
      star (through a second sensor named the Canopus Star Tracker,
      after the star used most frequently as the reference).  When
      the spacecraft attitude drifted by more than a small amount
      from the reference objects, the AACS fired small thrusters
      which returned the spacecraft to the proper orientation.  The
      Sun sensor was an optical potentiometer with a cadmium
      sulfide detector; its error was less than 0.01 degrees and
      its limit cycle was +/-0.05 degrees.  The Canopus Star
      Tracker was an image dissector tube with a cesium detector,
      an error of less than 0.01 degree, and a limit cycle of
      +/-0.05 degrees.
 
      Redundant (backup) sun sensors, star trackers, and computers
      were also part of the AACS.  The non-redundant portions of
      the AACS were those controlling the pointing of the
      instrument scan platform, which had two degrees of freedom --
      elevation and azimuth (see below).
 
 
    Propulsion Subsystem
    --------------------
      The propulsion system was part of the AACS and consisted of
      16 hydrazine thrusters.  These thrusters were also used to
      control the three-axis stabilization of the spacecraft.  Two
      thrusters on opposite sides of the spacecraft were used to
      perform positive roll turns around the +Z axis.  Two
      oppositely pointed thrusters were used to perform negative
      roll turns.  One thruster was used to perform positive yaw
      turns (around the +Y axis) and one was used to perform
      negative yaw turns.  One thruster was used to perform
      positive pitch turns (around the +X axis) and one was used to
      perform negative pitch turns.  A backup hydrazine system was
      connected to a redundant set of eight thrusters.
 
 
    Power Subsystem
    ---------------
      Spacecraft power was provided by three Radioisotope
      Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) mounted on a boom in the
      negative y-direction.  At Launch the three RTGs converted
      7000 watts of heat into 475 watts of electrical power.  RTG
      electrical output decreased by about 7 watts per year because
      of decay of the plutonium dioxide fissionable material and
      degradation of the silicon-germanium thermocouples.  The
      difference between available electrical power and the power
      required to operate spacecraft subsystems was called the
      &apos;power margin.&apos; Voyager Project guidelines required a power
      margin of at least 12 watts to guard against electrical
      transients and miscalculations; excess electrical power was
      dissipated as heat in a shunt radiator.
 
 
    Data Storage Subsystem
    ----------------------
      The Digital Tape Recorder (DTR) was used to store data when
      real-time communications with Earth were either not possible
      or not scheduled.  The DTR recorded data on eight tracks;
      rates were 115.2 kilobits per second (record only), 21.6
      kilobits per second (playback only), and 7.2 kilobits per
      second (record and playback).  Capacity of each track was 12
      images or equivalent.
 
 
    Computer Command Subsystem
    --------------------------
      The Computer Command Subsystem (CCS) consisted of two
      identical computer processors, their software algorithms, and
      associated electronic hardware.  The CCS was the central
      controller of the spacecraft.  During most of the Voyager
      mission the two CCS computers on each spacecraft were used
      non-redundantly to increase the command and processing
      capability of the spacecraft.
 
 
    Flight Data Subsystem
    ---------------------
      The Flight Data Subsystem (FDS) consisted of two
      reprogrammable digital computers and associated encoding
      hardware.  The FDS collected and formatted science and
      engineering telemetry data for transmission to Earth.
      Convolutional coding was imposed on all data transmitted from
      the spacecraft.  Additionally, both Golay encoding and Reed-
      Solomon encoding were available for use on spacecraft data.
      Data compression was also performed within the FDS.
 
 
    Science Boom
    ------------
      The Voyager science instrument boom carried the plasma
      detector, cosmic ray detector and the low energy charged
      particle detector.  The scan platform was mounted on the
      science boom.
 
 
    Scan Platform
    -------------
      Four instruments (Imaging, PhotoPolarimeter, Infra-Red
      Interferometric Spectrometer, and Ultra Violet Spectrometer)
      were mounted on the scan platform, which could be slewed by
      motors and gears (called actuators).  Elevation of the scan
      platform was measured with respect to a plane slightly offset
      (by approximately 7 degrees) from the spacecraft x-z plane;
      the spacecraft positive y-axis was at 97 degrees elevation
      (see Spacecraft Coordinate System above).  The scan platform
      azimuth reference was defined by the y-z plane, with zero
      azimuth being in the negative z-direction.  Drive actuators
      were controlled by fine feedback potentiometers; the error of
      each was less than 0.03 degrees, and the final pointing error
      of the scan platform was nominally +/-0.1 degrees (2-sigma
      per axis).  Subsequent analysis by the Navigation and
      Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) at JPL has shown larger
      errors during at least the Jupiter and Saturn encounters.
      High rate slews were at 1 deg/sec, medium rate slews were at
      0.33 deg/sec, and low rate slews were at 0.08 deg/sec.
 
 
    Magnetometer Boom
    -----------------
      Two low-field magnetometers were mounted on a 13-meter-long
      boom that was unfurled and extended automatically after
      Launch.  One low-field magnetometer was mounted at the end of
      the boom and a second was mounted about 3 meters from the
      end.  Two high-field magnetometers were mounted at the base
      of the boom.
 
 
    Science Sensors
    ---------------
      Each Voyager spacecraft carried instrumentation to support
      eleven science investigations.  Target body (or remote
      sensing) instruments included:
 
      (1) Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS)
      (2) Photopolarimeter Subsystem (PPS)
      (3) Infrared Radiometer Interferometer Spectrometer (IRIS)
      (4) Ultraviolet Spectrometer (UVS)
 
      Fields, waves, and particles (or in situ) sensors included:
 
      (1) Plasma Subsystem (PLS)
      (2) Low-Energy Charged Particle (LECP)
      (3) Cosmic-Ray Subsystem (CRS)
      (4) Magnetic Fields (MAG)
      (5) Plasma Wave Subsystem (PWS)
      (6) Planetary Radio Astronomy (PRA)
 
      The Radio Science (RSS) investigation was carried out using
      the on-board and ground elements of the Telecommunications
      Subsystem (TCS).  More information on instrumentation for
      each of the science investigations can be found elsewhere.
 
 
  Instrument Host Overview - DSN
  ==============================
    Voyager Radio Science investigations utilized instrumentation
    with elements on both the spacecraft and at ground stations of
    the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN).  Much of this was shared
    equipment, used for routine telecommunications as well as for
    Radio Science.
 
    The DSN is a telecommunications facility managed by the Jet
    Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology
    for NASA.  The primary function of the DSN is to provide
    two-way communications between the Earth and spacecraft
    exploring the solar system.  To carry out this function the DSN
    is equipped with high-power transmitters, low-noise amplifiers
    and receivers, and appropriate monitoring and control systems.
 
    During the Voyager era the DSN consisted of three complexes
    situated at approximately equally spaced longitudinal intervals
    around the globe at Goldstone (near Barstow, California),
    Robledo (near Madrid, Spain), and Tidbinbilla (near Canberra,
    Australia).  Two of the complexes are located in the northern
    hemisphere while the third is in the southern hemisphere.
 
    The network comprised several subnets, each of which included
    one antenna at each complex.  The subnets were defined
    according to the properties of their respective antennas.  Over
    the course of the Voyager Mission, those antennas were expanded
    and improved.  Nominal dimensions at the end (and beginning) of
    the Voyager Mission were: 70-m diameter (initially 64-m),
    standard 34-m diameter (initially 26-m), and high-efficiency
    34-m diameter (did not exist at beginning of Voyager).
 
    Additional ground equipment was provided by the Commonwealth
    Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) in
    Australia, the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science
    (ISAS) in Japan, and the National Radio Astronomy Observatory
    (NRAO) in the United States.  For the Voyager 2 encounters with
    Uranus and Neptune, the CSIRO 64-m diameter radio astronomy
    antenna near Parkes (Australia) was included in the receiving
    system for both telemetry and Radio Science.  For the Voyager 2
    encounter with Neptune, the ISAS 64-m diameter antenna near
    Usuda (Japan) was added for Radio Science and the NRAO Very
    Large Array (VLA) near Socorro (New Mexico) was added for
    telemetry.  The VLA consisted of 27 25-m antennas.  Parkes,
    Usuda, and the VLA were integrated with the permanent stations
    at Goldstone, Robledo, and Tidbinbilla by DSN personnel.

    The Plasma Wave Receiver on Voyager consists of both a
    16-channel spectrum analyzer covering the range of 10 Hertz to
    56.2 kiloHertz and a wideband waveform receiver which returns
    the waveform of waves in the frequency range of 40 Hertz to 12
    kiloHertz.  The spectrum analyzer provides data on a continual
    basis with a maximum temporal resolution of one spectrum per 4
    seconds.  The waveform receiver returns 4-bit samples of the
    electric field measured at a rate of 28,800 samples per second.
    Because of the very high data rate, the waveform samples must
    be transmitted in the same manner as the Voyager imaging
    information.  At Jupiter, some 10,000 48-second waveform frames
    were obtained.  At Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, the number of
    frames obtained was very small due to the lower telemetry rates
    available at the greater distances of those planets.
 
 
  Science Objectives
  ==================
    The primary science objective of the Voyager plasma wave
    investigation is to make the first surveys of the plasma wave
    and low frequency radio wave spectra in the magnetospheres of
    the outer planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
    Plasma waves participate in a fundamental manner in the
    dynamics of planetary magnetospheres and in the interactions of
    that magnetosphere with the external solar wind and internal
    perturbations such as those induced by satellites interior to
    the magnetosphere.  Plasma waves also provide diagnostic
    information about the plasma environment near the planets
    including such parameters as electron density and sometimes
    temperature.  The instrument is also sensitive to low frequency
    radio emissions and, therefore, acts as a low frequency
    extension to the Planetary Radio Astronomy investigation.
    Radio waves are often the only means of remotely observing
    regions of plasma not accessible to the spacecraft and also
    lead to remote diagnostics of plasma conditions.  The plasma
    wave receivers are also sensitive to the results of small dust
    particles impacting on various parts of the spacecraft at high
    velocities and, hence, provide a direct measure of the rate of
    impact, the density of the dust, and an estimate of the mass
    distribution of dust in the vicinity of the large planets,
    especially those with rings and otherwise dusty environments.
    Finally, the Plasma Wave Receiver will characterize the plasma
    wave and radio wave spectrum of the outer heliosphere and
    perhaps beyond, extending our understanding of solar wind
    plasma processes and wave-particle interactions to several tens
    of Astronomical Units.
 
 
  Operational Considerations
  ==========================
    The primary operational considerations of the PWS include
    maintaining the proper operating mode and obtaining waveform
    samples as often as the spacecraft tape recorder/downlink
    capabilities allow.  The standard instrument mode is with
    Waveform Power On and Input Gain State Hi.  For encounter
    periods, this corresponds to GS3GAINHI/WFMPWRON.  Since there
    has never been a period when the signal levels were so high as
    to require the Low input gain state, and it is highly unlikely
    that such levels will ever be encountered, Low Input Gain State
    should never be selected.  As long as there is power margin
    available, it is most straightforward to leave the Waveform
    Receiver Power on.  The power consumption is less than 0.5 Watt
    for this section, hence, the power savings afforded by turning
    it off is not large.  The most involved operational
    consideration is providing for the transmission of waveform
    data to the ground.  At Jupiter, the majority of the waveform
    data could be sent directly to the ground via the 115200 bps
    downlink.  This capability disappeared after Jupiter, however,
    because of the greater distance to the spacecraft, hence, lower
    telecon rates.  Since operating the A/D converter at a rate
    less than 28800 Hertz would result in aliasing, it is necessary
    to record the data at the 115200 bps rate on the spacecraft
    tape recorder using the appropriate data mode and playback the
    recorded data at a lower rate, commensurate with the link
    capabilities.  Again, a choice of the proper playback mode is
    required.  Since the data modes available on the spacecraft are
    highly dependent on mission phase, these modes are not
    described here.
 
 
  Calibration Description
  =======================
    The Voyager plasma wave receiver spectrum analyzers were
    calibrated by first establishing a relationship between input
    voltage (of a sine wave at the filter center frequency) and
    output voltage and second by measuring the effective bandwidth
    of the filter.  The bandwidth is measured by applying a random
    noise signal of known spectral density and by measuring the
    output voltage which, by the first part of the calibration, is
    related to the rms voltage of a sine wave.  Dividing the
    equivalent sine wave voltage squared by the input spectral
    density gives a bandwidth.  This procedure is repeated for each
    of the frequency channels.  A special calibration problem
    exists for the upper 8 frequency channels (1 kiloHertz and
    above) due to a failure of a &apos;tree switch&apos; in the Flight Data
    System.  An in-flight recalibration was attempted by using a
    Solar type III radio burst observed by both Voyager 1 and 2.
    The recalibration has known deficiencies, but it has been
    impossible to date to improve on them.  The deficiencies
    include &apos;flat-topped&apos; emissions where the emission appears to
    grow in amplitude up to some plateau level and then stay
    artificially flat for long periods of time.  The background
    level for each of the channels can vary in step-level fashion
    based on a number of engineering parameters which utilize the
    same failed circuitry.  Other results of the tree-switch
    recalibration is that the instrument sensitivity is decreased
    by some amount which is not well known and the absolute
    calibration could be off as well.  The calibration validity
    could be a function of frequency since some channels&apos; (mostly
    the upper 3 channels, 17.8 kHz and above) calibration has been
    verified with the PRA, but others have not and seem internally
    inconsistent with the lower frequency, unaffected channels.
 
 
  &apos;PWS ANTENNA&apos; Detector
  ======================
    Detector Type                  : DIPOLE ANTENNA
    Nominal Operating Temperature  : 298.000000
 
    The PWS uses a pair of 10 meter antenna elements as a balanced
    dipole antenna.  The two elements are extended from the
    spacecraft at right angles to each other.  (The elements are
    shared with the Planetary Radio Astronomy instrument, which
    uses them as a pair of monopoles so that measurements of the
    degree of right and left hand circular polarization can be
    made.) The PWS measures the voltage difference between the two
    elements which, when coupled with the effective length of the
    antenna system (7.07 m) yields an electric field strength in
    units of volt/meter.  The antenna system has the usual dipole
    antenna pattern which yields nearly 4*pi steradians in its
    field of view, although there is a range of fields of view
    where the detector response drops dramatically as one expects
    from a dipole pattern.
 
    The PWS antenna, used as a balanced dipole with an effective
    length of 7.07 meters gives a sensitivity to fluctuating (wave)
    electric fields down to the range of 5.E-6 volt/meter.  Even
    though the antenna elements are extended orthogonally to each
    other, the antenna pattern is still a dipole since the elements
    are short with respect to the wavelengths of the waves.  The
    presence of the various parts of the spacecraft in close
    proximity to the antenna can result in a distorted pattern, but
    this has not been studied in the frequency range of the PWS.
 
 
  Electronics
  ===========
    The PWS electronics system consists of three basic sections.
    The first is the power supply system which regulates and
    filters the 28 volt, 2400 Hertz spacecraft power supply and
    provides DC voltages to the remainder of the instrument
    electronics.  The second section is the spectrum analyzer which
    consists of two banks of 8 narrowband filters, and two
    logarithmic detectors, each of which provides an analog voltage
    proportional to the log of the signal strength delivered to the
    detector from any of the eight filters it services.  The analog
    outputs from these two compressors, as they are called, are
    sent to the Flight Data System of the spacecraft for conversion
    to an 8-bit digital value.  The spacecraft steps the inputs to
    the two compressors periodically (once per 0.5 seconds in GS3
    or encounter mode) so that signal strengths in each of the 16
    channels is measured over a 4-second interval.  The third
    section consists of a single broadband filter of 40 Hertz to 12
    kiloHertz, an automatic gain controlled amplifier, and a 4-bit
    A/D converter.  This section digitizes the electric field
    waveform at a 28800 Hertz rate.  The output amplitude is
    controlled by the automatic gain control in order to keep the
    signals within the useful range provided by the 4-bit
    digitization.

    The PWS instrument gain is high and the waveform receiver power
    is on.  This is the normal encounter operating mode of the
    instrument and places it in its most sensitive input gain state
    with the waveform receiver section turned on.  The fact that
    the waveform receiver power is on does not guarantee that
    waveform data is available.  The spacecraft is in the GS-3 data
    mode which cycles the plasma wave spectrum analyzer so that a
    complete spectrum is obtained every 4 seconds.

    The Plasma Wave Receiver on Voyager consists of both a
    16-channel spectrum analyzer covering the range of 10 Hertz to
    56.2 kiloHertz and a wideband waveform receiver which returns
    the waveform of waves in the frequency range of 40 Hertz to 12
    kiloHertz.  The spectrum analyzer provides data on a continual
    basis with a maximum temporal resolution of one spectrum per 4
    seconds.  The waveform receiver returns 4-bit samples of the
    electric field measured at a rate of 28,800 samples per second.
    Because of the very high data rate, the waveform samples must
    be transmitted in the same manner as the Voyager imaging
    information.  At Jupiter, some 10,000 48-second waveform frames
    were obtained.  At Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, the number of
    frames obtained was very small due to the lower telemetry rates
    available at the greater distances of those planets.
 
 
  Science Objectives
  ==================
    The primary science objective of the Voyager plasma wave
    investigation is to make the first surveys of the plasma wave
    and low frequency radio wave spectra in the magnetospheres of
    the outer planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
    Plasma waves participate in a fundamental manner in the
    dynamics of planetary magnetospheres and in the interactions of
    that magnetosphere with the external solar wind and internal
    perturbations such as those induced by satellites interior to
    the magnetosphere.  Plasma waves also provide diagnostic
    information about the plasma environment near the planets
    including such parameters as electron density and sometimes
    temperature.  The instrument is also sensitive to low frequency
    radio emissions and, therefore, acts as a low frequency
    extension to the Planetary Radio Astronomy investigation.
    Radio waves are often the only means of remotely observing
    regions of plasma not accessible to the spacecraft and also
    lead to remote diagnostics of plasma conditions.  The plasma
    wave receivers are also sensitive to the results of small dust
    particles impacting on various parts of the spacecraft at high
    velocities and, hence, provide a direct measure of the rate of
    impact, the density of the dust, and an estimate of the mass
    distribution of dust in the vicinity of the large planets,
    especially those with rings and otherwise dusty environments.
    Finally, the Plasma Wave Receiver will characterize the plasma
    wave and radio wave spectrum of the outer heliosphere and
    perhaps beyond, extending our understanding of solar wind
    plasma processes and wave-particle interactions to several tens
    of Astronomical Units.
 
 
  Operational Considerations
  ==========================
    The primary operational considerations of the PWS include
    maintaining the proper operating mode and obtaining waveform
    samples as often as the spacecraft tape recorder/downlink
    capabilities allow.  The standard instrument mode is with
    Waveform Power On and Input Gain State Hi.  For encounter
    periods, this corresponds to GS3GAINHI/WFMPWRON.  Since there
    has never been a period when the signal levels were so high as
    to require the Low input gain state, and it is highly unlikely
    that such levels will ever be encountered, Low Input Gain State
    should never be selected.  As long as there is power margin
    available, it is most straightforward to leave the Waveform
    Receiver Power on.  The power consumption is less than 0.5 Watt
    for this section, hence, the power savings afforded by turning
    it off is not large.  The most involved operational
    consideration is providing for the transmission of waveform
    data to the ground.  At Jupiter, the majority of the waveform
    data could be sent directly to the ground via the 115200 bps
    downlink.  This capability disappeared after Jupiter, however,
    because of the greater distance to the spacecraft, hence, lower
    telecon rates.  Since operating the A/D converter at a rate
    less than 28800 Hertz would result in aliasing, it is necessary
    to record the data at the 115200 bps rate on the spacecraft
    tape recorder using the appropriate data mode and playback the
    recorded data at a lower rate, commensurate with the link
    capabilities.  Again, a choice of the proper playback mode is
    required.  Since the data modes available on the spacecraft are
    highly dependent on mission phase, these modes are not
    described here.
 
 
  Calibration Description
  =======================
    The Voyager plasma wave receiver spectrum analyzers were
    calibrated by first establishing a relationship between input
    voltage (of a sine wave at the filter center frequency) and
    output voltage and second by measuring the effective bandwidth
    of the filter.  The bandwidth is measured by applying a random
    noise signal of known spectral density and by measuring the
    output voltage which, by the first part of the calibration, is
    related to the rms voltage of a sine wave.  Dividing the
    equivalent sine wave voltage squared by the input spectral
    density gives a bandwidth.  This procedure is repeated for each
    of the frequency channels.  A special calibration problem
    exists for the upper 8 frequency channels (1 kiloHertz and
    above) due to a failure of a &apos;tree switch&apos; in the Flight Data
    System.  An in-flight recalibration was attempted by using a
    Solar type III radio burst observed by both Voyager 1 and 2.
    The recalibration has known deficiencies, but it has been
    impossible to date to improve on them.  The deficiencies
    include &apos;flat-topped&apos; emissions where the emission appears to
    grow in amplitude up to some plateau level and then stay
    artificially flat for long periods of time.  The background
    level for each of the channels can vary in step-level fashion
    based on a number of engineering parameters which utilize the
    same failed circuitry.  Other results of the tree-switch
    recalibration is that the instrument sensitivity is decreased
    by some amount which is not well known and the absolute
    calibration could be off as well.  The calibration validity
    could be a function of frequency since some channels&apos; (mostly
    the upper 3 channels, 17.8 kHz and above) calibration has been
    verified with the PRA, but others have not and seem internally
    inconsistent with the lower frequency, unaffected channels.
 
 
  &apos;PWS ANTENNA&apos; Detector
  ======================
    Detector Type                  : DIPOLE ANTENNA
    Nominal Operating Temperature  : 298.000000
 
    The PWS uses a pair of 10 meter antenna elements as a balanced
    dipole antenna.  The two elements are extended from the
    spacecraft at right angles to each other.  (The elements are
    shared with the Planetary Radio Astronomy instrument, which
    uses them as a pair of monopoles so that measurements of the
    degree of right and left hand circular polarization can be
    made.) The PWS measures the voltage difference between the two
    elements which, when coupled with the effective length of the
    antenna system (7.07 m) yields an electric field strength in
    units of volt/meter.  The antenna system has the usual dipole
    antenna pattern which yields nearly 4*pi steradians in its
    field of view, although there is a range of fields of view
    where the detector response drops dramatically as one expects
    from a dipole pattern.
 
    The PWS antenna, used as a balanced dipole with an effective
    length of 7.07 meters gives a sensitivity to fluctuating (wave)
    electric fields down to the range of 5.E-6 volt/meter.  Even
    though the antenna elements are extended orthogonally to each
    other, the antenna pattern is still a dipole since the elements
    are short with respect to the wavelengths of the waves.  The
    presence of the various parts of the spacecraft in close
    proximity to the antenna can result in a distorted pattern, but
    this has not been studied in the frequency range of the PWS.
 
 
  Electronics
  ===========
    The PWS electronics system consists of three basic sections.
    The first is the power supply system which regulates and
    filters the 28 volt, 2400 Hertz spacecraft power supply and
    provides DC voltages to the remainder of the instrument
    electronics.  The second section is the spectrum analyzer which
    consists of two banks of 8 narrowband filters, and two
    logarithmic detectors, each of which provides an analog voltage
    proportional to the log of the signal strength delivered to the
    detector from any of the eight filters it services.  The analog
    outputs from these two compressors, as they are called, are
    sent to the Flight Data System of the spacecraft for conversion
    to an 8-bit digital value.  The spacecraft steps the inputs to
    the two compressors periodically (once per 0.5 seconds in GS3
    or encounter mode) so that signal strengths in each of the 16
    channels is measured over a 4-second interval.  The third
    section consists of a single broadband filter of 40 Hertz to 12
    kiloHertz, an automatic gain controlled amplifier, and a 4-bit
    A/D converter.  This section digitizes the electric field
    waveform at a 28800 Hertz rate.  The output amplitude is
    controlled by the automatic gain control in order to keep the
    signals within the useful range provided by the 4-bit
    digitization.

    The PWS instrument gain is high and the waveform receiver power
    is on.  This is the normal encounter operating mode of the
    instrument and places it in its most sensitive input gain state
    with the waveform receiver section turned on.  The fact that
    the waveform receiver power is on does not guarantee that

    The Plasma Wave Receiver on Voyager consists of both a
    16-channel spectrum analyzer covering the range of 10 Hertz to
    56.2 kiloHertz and a wideband waveform receiver which returns
    the waveform of waves in the frequency range of 40 Hertz to 12
    kiloHertz.  The spectrum analyzer provides data on a continual
    basis with a maximum temporal resolution of one spectrum per 4
    seconds.  The waveform receiver returns 4-bit samples of the
    electric field measured at a rate of 28,800 samples per second.
    Because of the very high data rate, the waveform samples must
    be transmitted in the same manner as the Voyager imaging
    information.  At Jupiter, some 10,000 48-second waveform frames
    were obtained.  At Saturn, the number of frames obtained was
    very small due to the lower telemetry rates available at the
    greater distance of that planet.
 
 
  Science Objectives
  ==================
    The primary science objective of the Voyager plasma wave
    investigation is to make the first surveys of the plasma wave
    and low frequency radio wave spectra in the magnetospheres of
    the outer planets: Jupiter and Saturn.  Plasma waves
    participate in a fundamental manner in the dynamics of
    planetary magnetospheres and in the interactions of that
    magnetosphere with the external solar wind and internal
    perturbations such as those induced by satellites interior to
    the magnetosphere.  Plasma waves also provide diagnostic
    information about the plasma environment near the planets
    including such parameters as electron density and sometimes
    temperature.  The instrument is also sensitive to low frequency
    radio emissions and, therefore, acts as a low frequency
    extension to the Planetary Radio Astronomy investigation.
    Radio waves are often the only means of remotely observing
    regions of plasma not accessible to the spacecraft and also
    lead to remote diagnostics of plasma conditions.  The plasma
    wave receivers are also sensitive to the results of small dust
    particles impacting on various parts of the spacecraft at high
    velocities and, hence, provide a direct measure of the rate of
    impact, the density of the dust, and an estimate of the mass
    distribution of dust in the vicinity of the large planets,
    especially those with rings and otherwise dusty environments.
    Finally, the Plasma Wave Receiver will characterize the plasma
    wave and radio wave spectrum of the outer heliosphere and
    perhaps beyond, extending our understanding of solar wind
    plasma processes and wave-particle interactions to several tens
    of Astronomical Units.
 
 
  Operational Considerations
  ==========================
    The primary operational considerations of the PWS include
    maintaining the proper operating mode and obtaining waveform
    samples as often as the spacecraft tape recorder/downlink
    capabilities allow.  The standard instrument mode is with
    Waveform Power On and Input Gain State Hi.  For encounter
    periods, this corresponds to GS3GAINHI/WFMPWRON.  Since there
    has never been a period when the signal levels were so high as
    to require the Low input gain state, and it is highly unlikely
    that such levels will ever be encountered, Low Input Gain State
    should never be selected.  As long as there is power margin
    available, it is most straightforward to leave the Waveform
    Receiver Power on.  The power consumption is less than 0.5 Watt
    for this section, hence, the power savings afforded by turning
    it off is not large.  The most involved operational
    consideration is providing for the transmission of waveform
    data to the ground.  At Jupiter, the majority of the waveform
    data could be sent directly to the ground via the 115200 bps
    downlink.  This capability disappeared after Jupiter, however,
    because of the greater distance to the spacecraft, hence, lower
    telecon rates.  Since operating the A/D converter at a rate
    less than 28800 Hertz would result in aliasing, it is necessary
    to record the data at the 115200 bps rate on the spacecraft
    tape recorder using the appropriate data mode and playback the
    recorded data at a lower rate, commensurate with the link
    capabilities.  Again, a choice of the proper playback mode is
    required.  Since the data modes available on the spacecraft are
    highly dependent on mission phase, these modes are not
    described here.
 
 
  Calibration Description
  =======================
    The Voyager plasma wave receiver spectrum analyzers were
    calibrated by first establishing a relationship between input
    voltage (of a sine wave at the filter center frequency) and
    output voltage and second by measuring the effective bandwidth
    of the filter.  The bandwidth is measured by applying a random
    noise signal of known spectral density and by measuring the
    output voltage which, by the first part of the calibration, is
    related to the rms voltage of a sine wave.  Dividing the
    equivalent sine wave voltage squared by the input spectral
    density gives a bandwidth.  This procedure is repeated for each
    of the frequency channels.
 
 
  &apos;PWS ANTENNA&apos; Detector
  ======================
    Detector Type                  : DIPOLE ANTENNA
    Nominal Operating Temperature  : 298.000000
 
    The PWS uses a pair of 10 meter antenna elements as a balanced
    dipole antenna.  The two elements are extended from the
    spacecraft at right angles to each other.  (The elements are
    shared with the Planetary Radio Astronomy instrument, which
    uses them as a pair of monopoles so that measurements of the
    degree of right and left hand circular polarization can be
    made.) The PWS measures the voltage difference between the two
    elements which, when coupled with the effective length of the
    antenna system (7.07 m) yields an electric field strength in
    units of volt/meter.  The antenna system has the usual dipole
    antenna pattern which yields nearly 4*pi steradians in its
    field of view, although there is a range of fields of view
    where the detector response drops dramatically as one expects
    from a dipole pattern.
 
    The PWS antenna, used as a balanced dipole with an effective
    length of 7.07 meters gives a sensitivity to fluctuating (wave)
    electric fields down to the range of 5.E-6 volt/meter.  Even
    though the antenna elements are extended orthogonally to each
    other, the antenna pattern is still a dipole since the elements
    are short with respect to the wavelengths of the waves.  The
    presence of the various parts of the spacecraft in close
    proximity to the antenna can result in a distorted pattern, but
    this has not been studied in the frequency range of the PWS.
 
 
  Electronics
  ===========
    The PWS electronics system consists of three basic sections.
    The first is the power supply system which regulates and
    filters the 28 volt, 2400 Hertz spacecraft power supply and
    provides DC voltages to the remainder of the instrument
    electronics.  The second section is the spectrum analyzer which
    consists of two banks of 8 narrowband filters, and two
    logarithmic detectors, each of which provides an analog voltage
    proportional to the log of the signal strength delivered to the
    detector from any of the eight filters it services.  The analog
    outputs from these two compressors, as they are called, are
    sent to the Flight Data System of the spacecraft for conversion
    to an 8-bit digital value.  The spacecraft steps the inputs to
    the two compressors periodically (once per 0.5 seconds in GS3
    or encounter mode) so that signal strengths in each of the 16
    channels is measured over a 4-second interval.  The third
    section consists of a single broadband filter of 40 Hertz to 12
    kiloHertz, an automatic gain controlled amplifier, and a 4-bit
    A/D converter.  This section digitizes the electric field
    waveform at a 28800 Hertz rate.  The output amplitude is
    controlled by the automatic gain control in order to keep the
    signals within the useful range provided by the 4-bit
    digitization.

    The PWS instrument gain is high and the waveform receiver power
    is on.  This is the normal encounter operating mode of the
    instrument and places it in its most sensitive input gain state
    with the waveform receiver section turned on.  The fact that
    the waveform receiver power is on does not guarantee that
    waveform data is available.  The spacecraft is in the GS-3 data
    mode which cycles the plasma wave spectrum analyzer so that a
    complete spectrum is obtained every 4 seconds.

  INSTRUMENT: PLASMA WAVE RECEIVER
  SPACECRAFT: VOYAGER 1

    The Plasma Wave Receiver on Voyager consists of both a
    16-channel spectrum analyzer covering the range of 10 Hertz to
    56.2 kiloHertz and a wideband waveform receiver which returns
    the waveform of waves in the frequency range of 40 Hertz to 12
    kiloHertz.  The spectrum analyzer provides data on a continual
    basis with a maximum temporal resolution of one spectrum per 4
    seconds.  The waveform receiver returns 4-bit samples of the
    electric field measured at a rate of 28,800 samples per second.
    Because of the very high data rate, the waveform samples must
    be transmitted in the same manner as the Voyager imaging
    information.  At Jupiter, some 10,000 48-second waveform frames
    were obtained.  At Saturn, the number of frames obtained was
    very small due to the lower telemetry rates available at the
    greater distance of that planet.
 
 
  Science Objectives
  ==================
    The primary science objective of the Voyager plasma wave
    investigation is to make the first surveys of the plasma wave
    and low frequency radio wave spectra in the magnetospheres of
    the outer planets: Jupiter and Saturn.  Plasma waves
    participate in a fundamental manner in the dynamics of
    planetary magnetospheres and in the interactions of that
    magnetosphere with the external solar wind and internal
    perturbations such as those induced by satellites interior to
    the magnetosphere.  Plasma waves also provide diagnostic
    information about the plasma environment near the planets
    including such parameters as electron density and sometimes
    temperature.  The instrument is also sensitive to low frequency
    radio emissions and, therefore, acts as a low frequency
    extension to the Planetary Radio Astronomy investigation.
    Radio waves are often the only means of remotely observing
    regions of plasma not accessible to the spacecraft and also
    lead to remote diagnostics of plasma conditions.  The plasma
    wave receivers are also sensitive to the results of small dust
    particles impacting on various parts of the spacecraft at high
    velocities and, hence, provide a direct measure of the rate of
    impact, the density of the dust, and an estimate of the mass
    distribution of dust in the vicinity of the large planets,
    especially those with rings and otherwise dusty environments.
    Finally, the Plasma Wave Receiver will characterize the plasma
    wave and radio wave spectrum of the outer heliosphere and
    perhaps beyond, extending our understanding of solar wind
    plasma processes and wave-particle interactions to several tens
    of Astronomical Units.
 
 
  Operational Considerations
  ==========================
    The primary operational considerations of the PWS include
    maintaining the proper operating mode and obtaining waveform
    samples as often as the spacecraft tape recorder/downlink
    capabilities allow.  The standard instrument mode is with
    Waveform Power On and Input Gain State Hi.  For encounter
    periods, this corresponds to GS3GAINHI/WFMPWRON.  Since there
    has never been a period when the signal levels were so high as
    to require the Low input gain state, and it is highly unlikely
    that such levels will ever be encountered, Low Input Gain State
    should never be selected.  As long as there is power margin
    available, it is most straightforward to leave the Waveform
    Receiver Power on.  The power consumption is less than 0.5 Watt
    for this section, hence, the power savings afforded by turning
    it off is not large.  The most involved operational
    consideration is providing for the transmission of waveform
    data to the ground.  At Jupiter, the majority of the waveform
    data could be sent directly to the ground via the 115200 bps
    downlink.  This capability disappeared after Jupiter, however,
    because of the greater distance to the spacecraft, hence, lower
    telecon rates.  Since operating the A/D converter at a rate
    less than 28800 Hertz would result in aliasing, it is necessary
    to record the data at the 115200 bps rate on the spacecraft
    tape recorder using the appropriate data mode and playback the
    recorded data at a lower rate, commensurate with the link
    capabilities.  Again, a choice of the proper playback mode is
    required.  Since the data modes available on the spacecraft are
    highly dependent on mission phase, these modes are not
    described here.
 
 
  Calibration Description
  =======================
    The Voyager plasma wave receiver spectrum analyzers were
    calibrated by first establishing a relationship between input
    voltage (of a sine wave at the filter center frequency) and
    output voltage and second by measuring the effective bandwidth
    of the filter.  The bandwidth is measured by applying a random
    noise signal of known spectral density and by measuring the
    output voltage which, by the first part of the calibration, is
    related to the rms voltage of a sine wave.  Dividing the
    equivalent sine wave voltage squared by the input spectral
    density gives a bandwidth.  This procedure is repeated for each
    of the frequency channels.
 
 
  &apos;PWS ANTENNA&apos; Detector
  ======================
    Detector Type                  : DIPOLE ANTENNA
    Nominal Operating Temperature  : 298.000000
 
    The PWS uses a pair of 10 meter antenna elements as a balanced
    dipole antenna.  The two elements are extended from the
    spacecraft at right angles to each other.  (The elements are
    shared with the Planetary Radio Astronomy instrument, which
    uses them as a pair of monopoles so that measurements of the
    degree of right and left hand circular polarization can be
    made.) The PWS measures the voltage difference between the two
    elements which, when coupled with the effective length of the
    antenna system (7.07 m) yields an electric field strength in
    units of volt/meter.  The antenna system has the usual dipole
    antenna pattern which yields nearly 4*pi steradians in its
    field of view, although there is a range of fields of view
    where the detector response drops dramatically as one expects
    from a dipole pattern.
 
    The PWS antenna, used as a balanced dipole with an effective
    length of 7.07 meters gives a sensitivity to fluctuating (wave)
    electric fields down to the range of 5.E-6 volt/meter.  Even
    though the antenna elements are extended orthogonally to each
    other, the antenna pattern is still a dipole since the elements
    are short with respect to the wavelengths of the waves.  The
    presence of the various parts of the spacecraft in close
    proximity to the antenna can result in a distorted pattern, but
    this has not been studied in the frequency range of the PWS.
 
 
  Electronics
  ===========
    The PWS electronics system consists of three basic sections.
    The first is the power supply system which regulates and
    filters the 28 volt, 2400 Hertz spacecraft power supply and
    provides DC voltages to the remainder of the instrument
    electronics.  The second section is the spectrum analyzer which
    consists of two banks of 8 narrowband filters, and two
    logarithmic detectors, each of which provides an analog voltage
    proportional to the log of the signal strength delivered to the
    detector from any of the eight filters it services.  The analog
    outputs from these two compressors, as they are called, are
    sent to the Flight Data System of the spacecraft for conversion
    to an 8-bit digital value.  The spacecraft steps the inputs to
    the two compressors periodically (once per 0.5 seconds in GS3
    or encounter mode) so that signal strengths in each of the 16
    channels is measured over a 4-second interval.  The third
    section consists of a single broadband filter of 40 Hertz to 12
    kiloHertz, an automatic gain controlled amplifier, and a 4-bit
    A/D converter.  This section digitizes the electric field
    waveform at a 28800 Hertz rate.  The output amplitude is
    controlled by the automatic gain control in order to keep the
    signals within the useful range provided by the 4-bit
    digitization.

    The PWS instrument gain is high and the waveform receiver power
    is on.  This is the normal encounter operating mode of the
    instrument and places it in its most sensitive input gain state
    with the waveform receiver section turned on.  The fact that
    the waveform receiver power is on does not guarantee that
    waveform data is available.  The spacecraft is in the GS-3 data
    mode which cycles the plasma wave spectrum analyzer so that a
    complete spectrum is obtained every 4 seconds.

    INSTRUMENT: PHOTOPOLARIMETER SUBSYSTEM
    SPACECRAFT: VOYAGER 2
 
 
  Instrument Overview
  ===================
    The Voyager Photopolarimeter Experiment (PPS) utilizes a general
    purpose filter photometer/polarimeter optimized for the encounter
    phase of the mission.

  Scientific Objectives
  =====================
    From [LILLIEETAL1977], pp. 159-160.
 
    The primary scientific objectives of the photopolarimeter
    investigation on the Voyager mission were divided into three
    categories---studies of atmospheres, satellite surfaces, and
    rings.
 
 
    Atmospheric Objectives
    ----------------------
      Specific objectives associated with the atmospheres were:
 
      (1) to use intensity and polarization measurements as a
      function of viewing angle and wavelength to determine the
      macrostructure (vertical distribution of atmospheric aerosols)
      and microstructure (particle size, shape, and probable
      composition) of atmospheres;
 
      (2) to use polarization measurements at large phase angles to
      constrain the particle shapes and compositions within clouds;
 
      (3) to search for dark side auroral emissions.
 
 
    Satellite Surface Objectives
    ----------------------------
      Specific scientific objectives associated with the surfaces of
      satellites were:
 
      (1) to measure or set upper limits on the density of their
      atmospheres;
 
      (2) to determine the texture and probable composition of their
      surfaces;
 
      (3) to determine the bond albedo.
 
      (4) to map the distribution of sodium vapor in the vicinity of
      Io and in Jupiter&apos;s magnetosphere.
 
 
    Planetary Ring Objectives
    -------------------------
      Specific scientific objectives for the study of planetary rings
      were:
 
      (1) to use intensity and polarization measurements of scattered
      light as a function of wavelength and viewing angle to provide
      information on the size, shape, and probable composition of the
      ring particles, as well as their density and radial
      distribution;
 
      (2) to use observations of the extinction and scattering of
      starlight to give additional information on particle size and
      ring optical depth.
 
 
  Optics and Detectors
  ====================
    From [LILLIEETAL1977], pp. 160-161.
 
    The instrument consists of the following components:
 
    (1) a 6-inch f/1.4 Dahl-Kirkham type Cassegrain telescope;
 
    (2) a four-position aperture wheel providing circular fields of
    view (FOVs) with diameters of 1/16, 1/4, 1, and 3.5 degrees;
 
    (3) an eight-position analyzer wheel with open, dark and
    calibration positions, plus with five polacoat analyzers with
    transmitting axes oriented at 0, 60, 120, 45, and 135 degrees
    rotation;
 
    (4) an eight-position filter wheel holding thin interference
    filters (see below);
 
    (5) an EMR 510-E-06 photomultiplier tube (PMT) with a tri-alkali
    (S-20) photocathode.
 
    Individual photon events in the PMT are detected with pulse
    counting electronics.
 
    The wide dynamical range required by the mission (4 to 6.e11
    photons /cm^2/s/Angstrom/ster) could be accommodated by FOV
    changes and an electronic gain change in the PMT capable of
    reducing the instrumental sensitivity by a factor of ~50.
 
    A shadow caster prevents direct sunlight from entering the
    aperture for phase angles &lt; 160 degrees.  A solar sensor turns
    off the high voltage if the PPS is pointed within 20 degrees of
    the Sun.
 
 
  Filters
  =======
    The effective wavelength of each filter, its nominal band width,
    typical instrumental sensitivities, and the particular atomic and
    molecular species to which it is sensitive are listed below (From
    [LILLIEETAL1977], Table I, p. 164).

  Operational Modes
  =================
    From [LILLIEETAL1977], pp. 161-162.
 
    The planned normal operational (encounter) mode of the PPS was to
    step through a programmed sequence of 40 filter/analyzer wheel
    combinations once every 24 sec.  Each measurement was to consist
    of a 400 millisecond integration period followed by a 200 ms
    period during which the next filter or analyzer would be stepped
    into place.  A full measurement set would thus consist of
    readings in the open, 0 degrees, 60 degrees, 120 degrees, and
    dark positions of the analyzer wheel for each of the eight
    filters.
 
    NOTE: Equipment failures and improved understanding of instrument
    usage considerations, however, caused substantial changes in this
    plan.  See the section on operational considerations below for
    further details.
 
    For stellar occultation and satellite eclipse measurements, the
    experiment was operated with filters and analyzers fixed in
    position and a 10-ms integration period.  This provided rapid
    measurements in order to resolve spikes in the light curves due
    to turbulence in the occulting planet&apos;s atmosphere, as seen in
    Earth-based observations.
 
    For ring observations, stellar occultations were observed using
    filter #4 (2650 Angstroms) and polarizer #7 (45 degrees).  A
    10-ms integration time was used to obtain maximum time resolution
    and the FOV set to 1 degree.
 
 
  Measured Parameters
  ===================
    From [LILLIEETAL1977], pp. 164-165.
 
    PPS raw values represent the number of photons events in the PMT
    counted by the detector during the given integration time.  Based
    on FOV, filter, and gain settings, this count could then be
    converted to an intensity.
 
    Four Stokes&apos; parameters, I, Q, U, and V, completely specify the
    state of polarization of a quasi-monochromatic wave.  The
    advantages of measuring and using Stokes&apos; parameters are:
 
      (1) They all have the same dimension of intensity;
      (2) They are additive;
      (3) From the Stokes&apos; parameters it is possible to generate the
          degree and plane of polarization and ellipticity.
 
    Since the value of V is generally small and its measurement
    requires a much more complex instrument, only I, Q, and U are
    determined.
 
    Total intensity I can be measured either with no polarizer in the
    optical train, or by summing polarizers with transmission axes at
    0, 60 and 120 degrees:
 
          I = 2[I(0) + I(60) + I(120)] / 3 .
 
    The Stokes&apos; parameter Q is given by
 
          Q = 2[2I(0) - I(60) - I(120)] / 3 .
 
    Similarly, U can be determined from
 
          U = 2[I(60) - I(120)] / sqrt(3) .
 
    The PPS data readout consists of a 30-bit digital word, of which
    20 bits provided the data count accumulated during the
    integration period, and 10 bits indicated instrument status.  In
    order to reduce the telemetry rate, data count bits were log
    compressed in the spacecraft FDS to 14 bits (a 10 bit mantissa
    and 4 bit exponent).  Log compression was removed from the FDS
    for the PPS occultation modes.  The nominal data rate was thus 40
    bps, with a maximum of 1023 1/2 bps and a minimum of 0.6 bps.
 
    NOTE: Data obtained during stellar occultation observations were
    not subjected to compression.
 
 
  Calibration
  ===========
    From [LILLIEETAL1977], p. 161.
 
    In-flight calibration was accomplished by observing a set of
    standard stars of known brightness and polarization, the sunlight
    scattered by an on-board calibration target (unpolarized light),
    and the light from stars and the planets reflected into the PPS
    from a mirror tilted to the Brewster angle (yielding 100%
    polarized light).  An internal Cerenkov radiation source mounted
    on the analyzer wheel provided a short term measure of the
    instrument&apos;s stability but was not used because comparison
    pre-flight calibration data was lost.
 
    The instrument is capable of measuring the polarization of
    reflected light from the planets and their satellites with a
    precision of +/- 0.5%, and their relative brightness with an
    accuracy of +/- 0.5 to 1%.  Absolute calibration is known to +/-
    3% in the visible and infrared, and to +/- 10% in the UV.  For
    measurements of low surface brightnesses the instrument&apos;s
    sensitivity ranged from ~140 counts/Rayleigh in the visible and
    UV to ~20 counts/Rayleigh in the infrared.
 
    Further discussions of intensity and polarization measurements
    can be found in, for example, [WESTETAL1981], [WESTETAL1983], and
    [PRYOR&amp;HORD1991].
 
 
  Operational Considerations
  ==========================
    The PPS aboard Voyager 1 suffered extreme sensitivity loss before
    and during Jupiter encounter.  This was deemed to be irreparable
    and the instrument was turned off before Saturn encounter.
    Voyager 1 data were never analyzed or archived.
 
    The PPS instrument on board Voyager 2 suffered two hardware
    failures that affected the ability to access wheel positions.  A
    spacecraft decoder failure affected the analyzer and a PPS
    internal chip failure affected the available filter positions.
    At Jupiter, filter positions 0, 2, 4, and 6 were used.
    Afterwards, only three positions, 2, 4, and 6, were used.  Four
    of the eight analyzer wheel positions were available.  Of these,
    135 and 45 degree orientations at wheel positions 6 and 7 were
    used to acquire polarization information.  Before closest
    approach at Jupiter, data taken are unreliable due to scattered
    light.
 
    Measurement sequences could be modified by changing the PPS
    look-up-table (LUT) in the spacecraft&apos;s Flight Data System (FDS).
    This controlled the filter and analyzer wheel positioning.  The
    changes were predominantly a result of instrument electronic
    failures and PMT usage issues more fully understood as the
    mission progressed.  Knowledge of which FDS load was in effect
    during each data observation is therefore necessary for proper
    analysis.

  Scientific Objectives
  =====================
    From [LILLIEETAL1977], pp. 159-160.
 
    The primary scientific objectives of the photopolarimeter
    investigation on the Voyager mission were divided into three
    categories---studies of atmospheres, satellite surfaces, and
    rings.
 
 
    Atmospheric Objectives
    ----------------------
      Specific objectives associated with the atmospheres were:
 
      (1) to use intensity and polarization measurements as a
      function of viewing angle and wavelength to determine the
      macrostructure (vertical distribution of atmospheric aerosols)
      and microstructure (particle size, shape, and probable
      composition) of atmospheres;
 
      (2) to use polarization measurements at large phase angles to
      constrain the particle shapes and compositions within clouds;
 
      (3) to search for dark side auroral emissions.
 
 
    Satellite Surface Objectives
    ----------------------------
      Specific scientific objectives associated with the surfaces of
      satellites were:
 
      (1) to measure or set upper limits on the density of their
      atmospheres;
 
      (2) to determine the texture and probable composition of their
      surfaces;
 
      (3) to determine the bond albedo.
 
      (4) to map the distribution of sodium vapor in the vicinity of
      Io and in Jupiter&apos;s magnetosphere.
 
 
    Planetary Ring Objectives
    -------------------------
      Specific scientific objectives for the study of planetary rings
      were:
 
      (1) to use intensity and polarization measurements of scattered
      light as a function of wavelength and viewing angle to provide
      information on the size, shape, and probable composition of the
      ring particles, as well as their density and radial
      distribution;
 
      (2) to use observations of the extinction and scattering of
      starlight to give additional information on particle size and
      ring optical depth.
 
 
  Optics and Detectors
  ====================
    From [LILLIEETAL1977], pp. 160-161.
 
    The instrument consists of the following components:
 
    (1) a 6-inch f/1.4 Dahl-Kirkham type Cassegrain telescope;
 
    (2) a four-position aperture wheel providing circular fields of
    view (FOVs) with diameters of 1/16, 1/4, 1, and 3.5 degrees;
 
    (3) an eight-position analyzer wheel with open, dark and
    calibration positions, plus with five polacoat analyzers with
    transmitting axes oriented at 0, 60, 120, 45, and 135 degrees
    rotation;
 
    (4) an eight-position filter wheel holding thin interference
    filters (see below);
 
    (5) an EMR 510-E-06 photomultiplier tube (PMT) with a tri-alkali
    (S-20) photocathode.
 
    Individual photon events in the PMT are detected with pulse
    counting electronics.
 
    The wide dynamical range required by the mission (4 to 6.e11
    photons /cm^2/s/Angstrom/ster) could be accommodated by FOV
    changes and an electronic gain change in the PMT capable of
    reducing the instrumental sensitivity by a factor of ~50.
 
    A shadow caster prevents direct sunlight from entering the
    aperture for phase angles &lt; 160 degrees.  A solar sensor turns
    off the high voltage if the PPS is pointed within 20 degrees of
    the Sun.
 
 
  Filters

    The effective wavelength of each filter, its nominal band width,
    typical instrumental sensitivities, and the particular atomic and
    molecular species to which it is sensitive are listed below (From
    [LILLIEETAL1977], Table I, p. 164).

  Operational Modes
  =================
    From [LILLIEETAL1977], pp. 161-162.
 
    The planned normal operational (encounter) mode of the PPS was to
    step through a programmed sequence of 40 filter/analyzer wheel
    combinations once every 24 sec.  Each measurement was to consist
    of a 400 millisecond integration period followed by a 200 ms
    period during which the next filter or analyzer would be stepped
    into place.  A full measurement set would thus consist of
    readings in the open, 0 degrees, 60 degrees, 120 degrees, and
    dark positions of the analyzer wheel for each of the eight
    filters.
 
    NOTE: Equipment failures and improved understanding of instrument
    usage considerations, however, caused substantial changes in this
    plan.  See the section on operational considerations below for
    further details.
 
    For stellar occultation and satellite eclipse measurements, the
    experiment was operated with filters and analyzers fixed in
    position and a 10-ms integration period.  This provided rapid
    measurements in order to resolve spikes in the light curves due
    to turbulence in the occulting planet&apos;s atmosphere, as seen in
    Earth-based observations.
 
    For ring observations, stellar occultations were observed using
    filter #4 (2650 Angstroms) and polarizer #7 (45 degrees).  A
    10-ms integration time was used to obtain maximum time resolution
    and the FOV set to 1 degree.

    0, 60 and 120 degrees:
 
          I = 2[I(0) + I(60) + I(120)] / 3 .
 
    The Stokes&apos; parameter Q is given by
 
          Q = 2[2I(0) - I(60) - I(120)] / 3 .
 
    Similarly, U can be determined from
 
          U = 2[I(60) - I(120)] / sqrt(3) .

            The aggregation of spacecraft sensors on the Voyager 2 spacecraft.
                                               
            The Voyager 2 spacecraft was built by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).          
            Its mass was 815 kilograms, including its own power, propulsion, and                
            communications systems and its own science instruments.                   
            Spacecraft electrical power was supplied by Radioisotope                  
            Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) that produced about 400 watts.           
            The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS),                   
            Computer Command Subsystem (CCS), and Flight Data Subsystem               
            (FDS) managed spacecraft operations.  Thrusters and gyroscopes                
            provided physical propulsion and attitude control.                        
            Communications between the spacecraft and Earth were carried              
            out via a high-gain radio antenna using both S-band and X-band            
            frequencies at data rates as high as 115.2 kilobits per second.           
            A Digital Tape Recorder (DTR) could save up to 500 million bits           
            when no Earth station was available for real-time data                    
            transmission.  Voyager control systems could record sets of               
            several thousand instructions, allowing autonomous operation              
            for days or weeks at a time.  Many of the systems were equipped
            with sensors, which fed engineering data to the ground where
            status and performance could be monitored.
            
            The spacecraft itself was built around its &apos;bus&apos; -- a decagonal           
            prism, which was about 2 meters in diameter and about 60 cm               
            deep.  Each of the ten sides of the bus was associated with a             
            &apos;bay&apos; containing engineering systems or science instrument                
            electronics.  Bay 1, for example, contained the radio                     
            transmitter.  The High-Gain Antenna (HGA) was mounted to the              
            end of the bus facing Earth.  The bays were numbered 1 through            
            10 in a clockwise direction when viewed from Earth.  Extending            
            away from the bus were three booms: a science boom and scan               
            platform to which most instruments were mounted, a magnetometer           
            boom, and a boom to which the RTGs were mounted.                          
            
            Spacecraft Coordinate System                                              
            ----------------------------                                              
            The centerline of the bus was the roll axis of the                      
            spacecraft; it also served as the z-axis of the spacecraft              
            coordinate system with the high-gain antenna (HGA) boresight            
            defining the negative z-direction.  The HGA boresight was               
            also defined as cone angle 0 degrees and as azimuth 180                 
            degrees, elevation 7 degrees.  The science boom, supporting             
            the scan platform, extended in the general direction of                 
            positive y; this boom was also defined as being at cone angle           
            90 degrees, clock angle 215 degrees and at azimuth 180                  
            degrees, elevation 97 degrees.  The boom supporting the RTGs              
            was mounted on the bus in generally the negative y direction.           
            The positive y-axis (yaw axis) of the spacecraft coordinate             
            system passed through Bay 3; the negative y-axis passed                 
            through Bay 8.  The x-axis (pitch axis) was in a direction              
            which defined a right-handed rectangular coordinate system.             
            The positive x-axis was at cone angle 90 degrees, clock angle           
            305 degrees (azimuth 270 degrees, elevation 90 degrees).                
            
            Telecommunications Subsystem                                              
            ----------------------------                                              
            The high-gain antenna was mounted to the spacecraft bus,                
            pointing in the negative z-direction.  It was a parabolic               
            reflector 3.7 meters in diameter with a feed that permitted             
            simultaneous operation at both S-band (13 cm wavelength) and            
            X-band (3.6 cm).  The half-power full-width of the antenna              
            beam was 0.6 degrees at X-band and 2.3 degrees at S-band.               
            The Low-Gain Antenna (LGA) was mounted on the feed structure            
            of the HGA and radiated approximately uniformly over the                
            hemisphere into which the HGA pointed.                                  
            
            The Telecommunications Subsystem (TCS) electronics included a           
            redundant pair of transponders, meaning that a failed                   
            functional unit in one transponder could be bypassed by                 
            swapping to the redundant unit.  The TCS could transmit                 
            science data on the X-band link at rates between 4.8 and                
            115.2 kilobits per second and engineering data on the S-band            
            link at 40 bits per second.  It could receive instructions              
            sent (uplinked) from ground stations at a rate of 16 bits per           
            second.  Commands were extracted from the uplink signal by              
            the Command Detector Unit (CDU) and were then sent to the               
            Computer Command Subsystem (CCS).                                       
            
            Spacecraft receivers were designed to lock to the uplink                
            signal.  Without locking, Doppler effects -- resulting from             
            relative motion of the spacecraft and ground station -- could           
            result in loss of the radio link as the frequency of the                
            received signal drifted. Voyager 2 differed from Voyager 1
            in this locking mechanism, which failed after launch.  Although
            lock could be achieved, the uplink signal had to be within a
            window only 100 Hz wide around the Voyager 2 receiver&apos;s rest
            frequency.  Engineers discovered both the problem and the
            solution during cruise and were able to tune the uplink
            transmitted from the ground so that commands could be sent
            and data received for encounters with all four of the 
            Voyager 2 target planets.
            
            Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem                               
            -------------------------------------------                               
            The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS)                  
            provided three-axis-stabilized control so that the spacecraft           
            could maintain a fixed orientation in space.  Attitude                  
            control was accomplished using gyroscopes or by celestial               
            reference.  The AACS also controlled motion of the scan                 
            platform, upon which the four &apos;remote sensing&apos; instruments              
            were mounted.                                                           
            
            Gyro control was used in special situations (e.g., trajectory           
            corrections and solar conjunctions) for periods of up to                
            several days.  The inertial reference unit operated with                
            tuned rotor gyros having an uncalibrated drift rate of less             
            than 0.5 degrees per hour and a calibrated drift rate of less           
            than 0.05 degrees per hour.                                             
            
            Celestial control was based on viewing the Sun (through a               
            sensor mounted on the high-gain antenna) and a single bright            
            star (through a second sensor named the Canopus Star Tracker,           
            after the star used most frequently as the reference).  When            
            the spacecraft attitude drifted by more than a small amount             
            from the reference objects, the AACS fired small thrusters              
            which returned the spacecraft to the proper orientation.  The           
            Sun sensor was an optical potentiometer with a cadmium                  
            sulfide detector; its error was less than 0.01 degrees and              
            its limit cycle was +/-0.05 degrees.  The Canopus Star                  
            Tracker was an image dissector tube with a cesium detector,             
            an error of less than 0.01 degree, and a limit cycle of                 
            +/-0.05 degrees.                                                        
            
            Redundant (backup) sun sensors, star trackers, and computers            
            were also part of the AACS.  The non-redundant portions of              
            the AACS were those controlling the pointing of the                     
            instrument scan platform, which had two degrees of freedom --           
            elevation and azimuth (see below).
            
            Propulsion Subsystem                                                      
            --------------------                                                      
            The propulsion system was part of the AACS and consisted of             
            16 hydrazine thrusters.  These thrusters were also used to              
            control the three-axis stabilization of the spacecraft.  Two            
            thrusters on opposite sides of the spacecraft were used to              
            perform positive roll turns around the +Z axis.  Two                    
            oppositely pointed thrusters were used to perform negative              
            roll turns.  One thruster was used to perform positive yaw              
            turns (around the +Y axis) and one was used to perform                  
            negative yaw turns.  One thruster was used to perform                   
            positive pitch turns (around the +X axis) and one was used to           
            perform negative pitch turns.  A backup hydrazine system was            
            connected to a redundant set of eight thrusters.                        
            
            Power Subsystem                                                           
            ---------------                                                           
            Spacecraft power was provided by three Radioisotope                     
            Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) mounted on a boom in the               
            negative y-direction.  At Launch the three RTGs converted               
            7000 watts of heat into 475 watts of electrical power.  RTG             
            electrical output decreased by about 7 watts per year because           
            of decay of the plutonium dioxide fissionable material and              
            degradation of the silicon-germanium thermocouples.  The                
            difference between available electrical power and the power             
            required to operate spacecraft subsystems was called the                
            &apos;power margin.&apos; Voyager Project guidelines required a power             
            margin of at least 12 watts to guard against electrical                 
            transients and miscalculations; excess electrical power was             
            dissipated as heat in a shunt radiator.                                 
            
            Data Storage Subsystem                                                    
            ----------------------                                                    
            The Digital Tape Recorder (DTR) was used to store data when             
            real-time communications with Earth were either not possible            
            or not scheduled.  The DTR recorded data on eight tracks;               
            rates were 115.2 kilobits per second (record only), 21.6                
            kilobits per second (playback only), and 7.2 kilobits per               
            second (record and playback).  Capacity of each track was 12            
            images or equivalent.                                                   
            
            Computer Command Subsystem                                                
            --------------------------                                                
            The Computer Command Subsystem (CCS) consisted of two                   
            identical computer processors, their software algorithms, and           
            associated electronic hardware.  The CCS was the central                
            controller of the spacecraft.  During most of the Voyager               
            mission the two CCS computers on each spacecraft were used              
            non-redundantly to increase the command and processing                  
            capability of the spacecraft.                                           
            
            Flight Data Subsystem                                                     
            ---------------------                                                     
            The Flight Data Subsystem (FDS) consisted of two                        
            reprogrammable digital computers and associated encoding                
            hardware.  The FDS collected and formatted science and                  
            engineering telemetry data for transmission to Earth.                   
            Convolutional coding was imposed on all data transmitted from           
            the spacecraft.  Additionally, both Golay encoding and Reed-            
            Solomon encoding were available for use on spacecraft data.             
            Data compression was also performed within the FDS.                     
            
            Science Boom                                                              
            ------------                                                              
            The Voyager science instrument boom carried the plasma                  
            detector, cosmic ray detector and the low energy charged                
            particle detector.  The scan platform was mounted on the                
            science boom.                                                           
            
            Scan Platform                                                             
            -------------                                                             
            Four instruments (Imaging, PhotoPolarimeter, Infra-Red                  
            Interferometric Spectrometer, and Ultra Violet Spectrometer)            
            were mounted on the scan platform, which could be slewed by             
            motors and gears (called actuators).  Elevation of the scan             
            platform was measured with respect to a plane slightly offset           
            (by approximately 7 degrees) from the spacecraft x-z plane;             
            the spacecraft positive y-axis was at 97 degrees elevation              
            (see Spacecraft Coordinate System above).  The scan platform            
            azimuth reference was defined by the y-z plane, with zero               
            azimuth being in the negative z-direction.  Drive actuators             
            were controlled by fine feedback potentiometers; the error of           
            each was less than 0.03 degrees, and the final pointing error           
            of the scan platform was nominally +/-0.1 degrees (2-sigma              
            per axis).  Subsequent analysis by the Navigation and                   
            Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) at JPL showed larger           
            errors during at least the Jupiter and Saturn encounters.               
            High rate slews of 1 deg/sec were discontinued after the                
            azimuth drive mechanism on Voyager 2 temporarily froze a                
            short time after Saturn closest approach.  The medium slew              
            rate was 0.33 deg/sec, and the low slew rate was 0.08                   
            deg/sec.                                                                
            
            Magnetometer Boom                                                         
            -----------------                                                         
            Two low-field magnetometers were mounted on a 13-meter-long             
            boom that was unfurled and extended automatically after                 
            Launch.  One low-field magnetometer was mounted at the end of           
            the boom and a second was mounted about 3 meters from the               
            end.  Two high-field magnetometers were mounted at the base             
            of the boom.

            The aggregation of spacecraft sensors on the Voyager 2 spacecraft.
                                               
            The Voyager 2 spacecraft was built by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).          
            Its mass was 815 kilograms, including its own power, propulsion, and                
            communications systems and its own science instruments.                   
            Spacecraft electrical power was supplied by Radioisotope                  
            Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) that produced about 400 watts.           
            The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS),                   
            Computer Command Subsystem (CCS), and Flight Data Subsystem               
            (FDS) managed spacecraft operations.  Thrusters and gyroscopes                
            provided physical propulsion and attitude control.                        
            Communications between the spacecraft and Earth were carried              
            out via a high-gain radio antenna using both S-band and X-band            
            frequencies at data rates as high as 115.2 kilobits per second.           
            A Digital Tape Recorder (DTR) could save up to 500 million bits           
            when no Earth station was available for real-time data                    
            transmission.  Voyager control systems could record sets of               
            several thousand instructions, allowing autonomous operation              
            for days or weeks at a time.  Many of the systems were equipped
            with sensors, which fed engineering data to the ground where
            status and performance could be monitored.
            
            The spacecraft itself was built around its &apos;bus&apos; -- a decagonal           
            prism, which was about 2 meters in diameter and about 60 cm               
            deep.  Each of the ten sides of the bus was associated with a             
            &apos;bay&apos; containing engineering systems or science instrument                
            electronics.  Bay 1, for example, contained the radio                     
            transmitter.  The High-Gain Antenna (HGA) was mounted to the              
            end of the bus facing Earth.  The bays were numbered 1 through            
            10 in a clockwise direction when viewed from Earth.  Extending            
            away from the bus were three booms: a science boom and scan               
            platform to which most instruments were mounted, a magnetometer           
            boom, and a boom to which the RTGs were mounted.                          
            
            Spacecraft Coordinate System                                              
            ----------------------------                                              
            The centerline of the bus was the roll axis of the                      
            spacecraft; it also served as the z-axis of the spacecraft              
            coordinate system with the high-gain antenna (HGA) boresight            
            defining the negative z-direction.  The HGA boresight was               
            also defined as cone angle 0 degrees and as azimuth 180                 
            degrees, elevation 7 degrees.  The science boom, supporting             
            the scan platform, extended in the general direction of                 
            positive y; this boom was also defined as being at cone angle           
            90 degrees, clock angle 215 degrees and at azimuth 180                  
            degrees, elevation 97 degrees.  The boom supporting the RTGs              
            was mounted on the bus in generally the negative y direction.           
            The positive y-axis (yaw axis) of the spacecraft coordinate             
            system passed through Bay 3; the negative y-axis passed                 
            through Bay 8.  The x-axis (pitch axis) was in a direction              
            which defined a right-handed rectangular coordinate system.             
            The positive x-axis was at cone angle 90 degrees, clock angle           
            305 degrees (azimuth 270 degrees, elevation 90 degrees).                
            
            Telecommunications Subsystem                                              
            ----------------------------                                              
            The high-gain antenna was mounted to the spacecraft bus,                
            pointing in the negative z-direction.  It was a parabolic               
            reflector 3.7 meters in diameter with a feed that permitted             
            simultaneous operation at both S-band (13 cm wavelength) and            
            X-band (3.6 cm).  The half-power full-width of the antenna              
            beam was 0.6 degrees at X-band and 2.3 degrees at S-band.               
            The Low-Gain Antenna (LGA) was mounted on the feed structure            
            of the HGA and radiated approximately uniformly over the                
            hemisphere into which the HGA pointed.                                  
            
            The Telecommunications Subsystem (TCS) electronics included a           
            redundant pair of transponders, meaning that a failed                   
            functional unit in one transponder could be bypassed by                 
            swapping to the redundant unit.  The TCS could transmit                 
            science data on the X-band link at rates between 4.8 and                
            115.2 kilobits per second and engineering data on the S-band            
            link at 40 bits per second.  It could receive instructions              
            sent (uplinked) from ground stations at a rate of 16 bits per           
            second.  Commands were extracted from the uplink signal by              
            the Command Detector Unit (CDU) and were then sent to the               
            Computer Command Subsystem (CCS).                                       
            
            Spacecraft receivers were designed to lock to the uplink                
            signal.  Without locking, Doppler effects -- resulting from             
            relative motion of the spacecraft and ground station -- could           
            result in loss of the radio link as the frequency of the                
            received signal drifted. Voyager 2 differed from Voyager 1
            in this locking mechanism, which failed after launch.  Although
            lock could be achieved, the uplink signal had to be within a
            window only 100 Hz wide around the Voyager 2 receiver&apos;s rest
            frequency.  Engineers discovered both the problem and the
            solution during cruise and were able to tune the uplink
            transmitted from the ground so that commands could be sent
            and data received for encounters with all four of the 
            Voyager 2 target planets.
            
            Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem                               
            -------------------------------------------                               
            The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS)                  
            provided three-axis-stabilized control so that the spacecraft           
            could maintain a fixed orientation in space.  Attitude                  
            control was accomplished using gyroscopes or by celestial               
            reference.  The AACS also controlled motion of the scan                 
            platform, upon which the four &apos;remote sensing&apos; instruments              
            were mounted.                                                           
            
            Gyro control was used in special situations (e.g., trajectory           
            corrections and solar conjunctions) for periods of up to                
            several days.  The inertial reference unit operated with                
            tuned rotor gyros having an uncalibrated drift rate of less             
            than 0.5 degrees per hour and a calibrated drift rate of less           
            than 0.05 degrees per hour.                                             
            
            Celestial control was based on viewing the Sun (through a               
            sensor mounted on the high-gain antenna) and a single bright            
            star (through a second sensor named the Canopus Star Tracker,           
            after the star used most frequently as the reference).  When            
            the spacecraft attitude drifted by more than a small amount             
            from the reference objects, the AACS fired small thrusters              
            which returned the spacecraft to the proper orientation.  The           
            Sun sensor was an optical potentiometer with a cadmium                  
            sulfide detector; its error was less than 0.01 degrees and              
            its limit cycle was +/-0.05 degrees.  The Canopus Star                  
            Tracker was an image dissector tube with a cesium detector,             
            an error of less than 0.01 degree, and a limit cycle of                 
            +/-0.05 degrees.                                                        
            
            Redundant (backup) sun sensors, star trackers, and computers            
            were also part of the AACS.  The non-redundant portions of              
            the AACS were those controlling the pointing of the                     
            instrument scan platform, which had two degrees of freedom --           
            elevation and azimuth (see below).
            
            Propulsion Subsystem                                                      
            --------------------                                                      
            The propulsion system was part of the AACS and consisted of             
            16 hydrazine thrusters.  These thrusters were also used to              
            control the three-axis stabilization of the spacecraft.  Two            
            thrusters on opposite sides of the spacecraft were used to              
            perform positive roll turns around the +Z axis.  Two                    
            oppositely pointed thrusters were used to perform negative              
            roll turns.  One thruster was used to perform positive yaw              
            turns (around the +Y axis) and one was used to perform                  
            negative yaw turns.  One thruster was used to perform                   
            positive pitch turns (around the +X axis) and one was used to           
            perform negative pitch turns.  A backup hydrazine system was            
            connected to a redundant set of eight thrusters.                        
            
            Power Subsystem                                                           
            ---------------                                                           
            Spacecraft power was provided by three Radioisotope                     
            Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) mounted on a boom in the               
            negative y-direction.  At Launch the three RTGs converted               
            7000 watts of heat into 475 watts of electrical power.  RTG             
            electrical output decreased by about 7 watts per year because           
            of decay of the plutonium dioxide fissionable material and              
            degradation of the silicon-germanium thermocouples.  The                
            difference between available electrical power and the power             
            required to operate spacecraft subsystems was called the                
            &apos;power margin.&apos; Voyager Project guidelines required a power             
            margin of at least 12 watts to guard against electrical                 
            transients and miscalculations; excess electrical power was             
            dissipated as heat in a shunt radiator.                                 
            
            Data Storage Subsystem                                                    
            ----------------------                                                    
            The Digital Tape Recorder (DTR) was used to store data when             
            real-time communications with Earth were either not possible            
            or not scheduled.  The DTR recorded data on eight tracks;               
            rates were 115.2 kilobits per second (record only), 21.6                
            kilobits per second (playback only), and 7.2 kilobits per               
            second (record and playback).  Capacity of each track was 12            
            images or equivalent.                                                   
            
            Computer Command Subsystem                                                
            --------------------------                                                
            The Computer Command Subsystem (CCS) consisted of two                   
            identical computer processors, their software algorithms, and           
            associated electronic hardware.  The CCS was the central                
            controller of the spacecraft.  During most of the Voyager               
            mission the two CCS computers on each spacecraft were used              
            non-redundantly to increase the command and processing                  
            capability of the spacecraft.                                           
            
            Flight Data Subsystem                                                     
            ---------------------                                                     
            The Flight Data Subsystem (FDS) consisted of two                        
            reprogrammable digital computers and associated encoding                
            hardware.  The FDS collected and formatted science and                  
            engineering telemetry data for transmission to Earth.                   
            Convolutional coding was imposed on all data transmitted from           
            the spacecraft.  Additionally, both Golay encoding and Reed-            
            Solomon encoding were available for use on spacecraft data.             
            Data compression was also performed within the FDS.                     
            
            Science Boom                                                              
            ------------                                                              
            The Voyager science instrument boom carried the plasma                  
            detector, cosmic ray detector and the low energy charged                
            particle detector.  The scan platform was mounted on the                
            science boom.                                                           
            
            Scan Platform                                                             
            -------------                                                             
            Four instruments (Imaging, PhotoPolarimeter, Infra-Red                  
            Interferometric Spectrometer, and Ultra Violet Spectrometer)            
            were mounted on the scan platform, which could be slewed by             
            motors and gears (called actuators).  Elevation of the scan             
            platform was measured with respect to a plane slightly offset           
            (by approximately 7 degrees) from the spacecraft x-z plane;             
            the spacecraft positive y-axis was at 97 degrees elevation              
            (see Spacecraft Coordinate System above).  The scan platform            
            azimuth reference was defined by the y-z plane, with zero               
            azimuth being in the negative z-direction.  Drive actuators             
            were controlled by fine feedback potentiometers; the error of           
            each was less than 0.03 degrees, and the final pointing error           
            of the scan platform was nominally +/-0.1 degrees (2-sigma              
            per axis).  Subsequent analysis by the Navigation and                   
            Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) at JPL showed larger           
            errors during at least the Jupiter and Saturn encounters.               
            High rate slews of 1 deg/sec were discontinued after the                
            azimuth drive mechanism on Voyager 2 temporarily froze a                
            short time after Saturn closest approach.  The medium slew              
            rate was 0.33 deg/sec, and the low slew rate was 0.08                   
            deg/sec.                                                                
            
            Magnetometer Boom                                                         
            -----------------                                                         
            Two low-field magnetometers were mounted on a 13-meter-long             
            boom that was unfurled and extended automatically after                 
            Launch.  One low-field magnetometer was mounted at the end of           
            the boom and a second was mounted about 3 meters from the               
            end.  Two high-field magnetometers were mounted at the base             
            of the boom.

    Instrument Overview
    ===================
      Voyager Radio Science investigations at the giant planets
      utilized instrumentation with elements both on the spacecraft
      and at the DSN.  Much of this was shared equipment, being used
      for routine telecommunications as well as for Radio Science.
      The performance and calibration of both the spacecraft and
      tracking stations directly affected the radio science data
      accuracy, and they played a major role in determining the
      quality of the results.  The spacecraft part of the radio
      science instrument is described immediately below; in most
      cases, the description applies equally well to both Voyager 1
      and Voyager 2 and it applies throughout the Voyager mission.  
      The description of the DSN (ground) part of the instrument may
      be found in DSN context products.  
 
    Instrument Specifications
    =========================
      The Voyager spacecraft telecommunications subsystem served as
      part of a radio science subsystem for investigations of the
      giant planets.  Many details of the subsystem are unknown; its
      &apos;build date&apos; is taken to be 1977-09-05, the launch date for
      Voyager 1.

    Instrument Overview
    ===================
      The spacecraft radio system was constructed around a redundant
      pair of transponders.  Each transponder was equipped with an
      S-band receiver (2115 MHz nominal frequency) and transmitters
      at both S-band (2295 MHz nominal) and X-band (8415 MHz nominal).
      Compared with S-band, X-band was less sensitive to plasma effects
      by a factor of about 10; use of both frequencies coherently on
      the &apos;downlink&apos; allowed estimation of plasma content along the
      radio path.  Use of X-band also significantly improved the
      quality of radio tracking data for gravity investigations.
 
      The transponder generated downlink signals in either &apos;coherent&apos;
      or &apos;non-coherent&apos; modes, also known as &apos;two-way&apos; and &apos;one-way&apos;,
      respectively.  When operating in the coherent mode, the
      transmitted carrier frequency was derived coherently from the
      received uplink carrier frequency with a &apos;turn-around ratio&apos; of
      240/221 at S-band and (11/3)*240/221 at X-band.
 
      In non-coherent mode the transmitted frequency was controlled
      by an on-board oscillator; the X- and S-band remained coherent
      in the ratio 11/3.  A single Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) was
      used during radio occultations; it provided stabilities
      several orders of magnitude better than the conventional
      crystal oscillators, which were part of each transponder.
 
      Stability of the Voyager USO was specified in terms of its
      Allan Deviation -- the fractional frequency deviation from
      linear drift.  Over 10 minute periods, the Allan
      Deviation ranged from 10**-12 to 4 10**-12 for integrations of
      1-10 sec.  Long-term fractional drift of the oscillator was
      about 5 10**-11 per day.  Although the oscillator was hardened,
      there were discontinuities in the drift when the spacecraft
      passed through the radiation belts of the outer planets.
      Equivalent X-band microwave frequencies for the Voyager 1 USO
      during key events were:
                     8,414,995,272.530 Hz (Titan occultation)
                     8,414,995,272.376 Hz (Saturn occultation)
      Multiplying by 3/11 yields the S-band frequency.
 
      Traveling wave tube or solid state amplifiers boosted the
      transponder output.  Output powers of 9 and 26  watts could
      be selected at S-band; the choices at X-band were 12 and 22
      watts.
 
      The signals were radiated via a 3.66 m diameter parabolic high
      gain antenna (HGA).  The transmit boresight gain of the HGA was
      36 dB at S-band and 47 dB at X-band.  The half-power
      half-width of the antenna beam was 0.32 degrees at X-band and
      1.1 degrees at S-band.  Transmit polarization was right-hand
      circular at S-band and either right- or left-hand circular at
      X-band.  A Low-Gain Antenna (LGA) was mounted on the feed
      structure of the HGA and radiated approximately uniformly over
      the hemisphere into which the HGA pointed.  It was used during
      maneuvers, spacecraft anomalies, and at other times when the
      HGA was not appropriate.
 
      For receiving, the S-band HGA gain was 35 dB at 2115 MHz and the
      polarization was right-hand circular.  The receiving system
      noise temperature was approximately 2000 K, the carrier tracking
      loop bandwidth was 18 Hz, and the ranging channel noise
      bandwidth was 1.5 MHz.
 
    Operational Considerations
    ==========================
      Descriptions given here are for nominal performance.  The
      spacecraft transponder system comprised redundant units,
      each with slightly different characteristics.  As the
      transponder units ages, their performance changed slightly.
      More importantly, the performance for radio science depended
      on operational factors such as the modulation state for the
      transmitters, which cannot be predicted in advance.  The
      performance also depended on factors which were not always
      under the control of the Voyager Project.
 
      Spacecraft receivers were designed to lock to the uplink
      signal.  Without locking, Doppler effects -- resulting from
      relative motion of the spacecraft and ground station -- could
      result in loss of the radio link as the frequency of the
      received signal drifted.  A series of failures in the Voyager 2
      receivers left that transponder unable to track the uplink 
      signal.  Beginning in April 1978, Doppler shifts were predicted 
      and the uplink carrier was tuned so that Voyager 2 would see what
      appeared to be a signal at constant frequency (to an accuracy of 
      100 Hz.  There were no such problems with Voyager 1.
 
      During deep occultations by the giant planets, the bending angle
      resulting from refraction exceeded 10 degrees in some cases --
      well beyond the half power beamwidth of the spacecraft antenna.
      In those cases, the pointing of the HGA was adjusted so that
      it followed a &apos;virtual&apos; Earth and maximum signal strength could
      be sustained.  These &apos;limb-track&apos; maneuvers were critically
      dependent on accurate timing during the encounter.  To protect
      against Voyager 1 timing errors at Titan (primarily from
      uncertainties in the radius and position of the satellite),
      no limb-track was attempted during ingress, and a fixed
      antenna offset was used during egress.  Fortunately, timing was
      accurate enough that useful data were obtained from each event.
 
      Although the spacecraft radioisotope thermoelectric generators
      were not dependent on solar flux for power, their output decayed
      as the Voyager spacecraft moved outward through the solar
      system.  During encounters with the outer planets, caution was
      required in budgeting power and the high-power mode could not
      be used for the radio transmitters.
 
    Calibration Description
    =======================
      Prior to and during some encounter sequences, the spacecraft
      was commanded to execute a &apos;mini-ASCAL&apos; maneuver.  The HGA was
      moved slightly above the Earth line then slightly below the
      Earth line.  The procedure was repeated to the left and right
      of the Earth line so that a &apos;cross-hair&apos; pattern was mapped
      out.  During the maneuver, the amplitude of the carrier
      signal was measured carefully.  Analysis of the results
      showed whether the HGA was pointed accurately and, if not,
      allowed estimation of the error magnitude and direction.
 
      Prior to and after encounters, the spacecraft frequency
      reference was switched to the USO for several hours and the
      carrier signal was monitored using equipment at the DSN.
      These &apos;USO Tests&apos; were used to calibrate the frequency and
      frequency drift of the USO.  USO tests were particularly
      important before and after the spacecraft entered a severe
      radiation environment since the radiation typically damaged
      the crystal and changed its characteristics slightly.
 
    Platform Mounting Descriptions
    ==============================
      The centerline of the bus was the roll axis of the
      spacecraft; it also served as the z-axis of the spacecraft
      coordinate system with the high-gain antenna (HGA) boresight
      defining the negative z-direction.  The HGA boresight was
      also defined as cone angle 0 degrees and as azimuth 180
      degrees, elevation 7 degrees.  The Low-Gain Antenna (LGA)
      was mounted on the feed structure of the HGA and radiated
      approximately uniformly over the hemisphere into which the
      HGA pointed.
 
    Instrument Section / Operating Mode Descriptions
    ================================================
      The Voyager radio system consisted of two sections, which
      could be operated in the following modes:
 
      Section      Mode
      -------------------------------------------
      Oscillator   two-way (coherent)

    Instrument Overview
    ===================
      Voyager Radio Science investigations at the giant planets
      utilized instrumentation with elements both on the spacecraft
      and at the DSN.  Much of this was shared equipment, being used
      for routine telecommunications as well as for Radio Science.
      The performance and calibration of both the spacecraft and
      tracking stations directly affected the radio science data
      accuracy, and they played a major role in determining the
      quality of the results.  The spacecraft part of the radio
      science instrument is described immediately below; in most
      cases, the description applies equally well to both Voyager 1
      and Voyager 2 and it applies throughout the Voyager mission.  
      The description of the DSN (ground) part of the instrument may
      be found in DSN context products.  
 
    Instrument Specifications
    =========================
      The Voyager spacecraft telecommunications subsystem served as
      part of a radio science subsystem for investigations of the
      giant planets.  Many details of the subsystem are unknown; its
      &apos;build date&apos; is taken to be 1977-09-05, the launch date for
      Voyager 1.

    Instrument Overview
    ===================
      The spacecraft radio system was constructed around a redundant
      pair of transponders.  Each transponder was equipped with an
      S-band receiver (2115 MHz nominal frequency) and transmitters
      at both S-band (2295 MHz nominal) and X-band (8415 MHz nominal).
      Compared with S-band, X-band was less sensitive to plasma effects
      by a factor of about 10; use of both frequencies coherently on
      the &apos;downlink&apos; allowed estimation of plasma content along the
      radio path.  Use of X-band also significantly improved the
      quality of radio tracking data for gravity investigations.
 
      The transponder generated downlink signals in either &apos;coherent&apos;
      or &apos;non-coherent&apos; modes, also known as &apos;two-way&apos; and &apos;one-way&apos;,
      respectively.  When operating in the coherent mode, the
      transmitted carrier frequency was derived coherently from the
      received uplink carrier frequency with a &apos;turn-around ratio&apos; of
      240/221 at S-band and (11/3)*240/221 at X-band.
 
      In non-coherent mode the transmitted frequency was controlled
      by an on-board oscillator; the X- and S-band remained coherent
      in the ratio 11/3.  A single Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) was
      used during radio occultations; it provided stabilities
      several orders of magnitude better than the conventional
      crystal oscillators, which were part of each transponder.
 
      Stability of the Voyager USO was specified in terms of its
      Allan Deviation -- the fractional frequency deviation from
      linear drift.  Over 10 minute periods, the Allan
      Deviation ranged from 10**-12 to 4 10**-12 for integrations of
      1-10 sec.  Long-term fractional drift of the oscillator was
      about 5 10**-11 per day.  Although the oscillator was hardened,
      there were discontinuities in the drift when the spacecraft
      passed through the radiation belts of the outer planets.
      Equivalent X-band microwave frequencies for the Voyager 1 USO
      during key events were:
                     8,414,995,272.530 Hz (Titan occultation)
                     8,414,995,272.376 Hz (Saturn occultation)
      Multiplying by 3/11 yields the S-band frequency.
 
      Traveling wave tube or solid state amplifiers boosted the
      transponder output.  Output powers of 9 and 26  watts could
      be selected at S-band; the choices at X-band were 12 and 22
      watts.
 
      The signals were radiated via a 3.66 m diameter parabolic high
      gain antenna (HGA).  The transmit boresight gain of the HGA was
      36 dB at S-band and 47 dB at X-band.  The half-power
      half-width of the antenna beam was 0.32 degrees at X-band and
      1.1 degrees at S-band.  Transmit polarization was right-hand
      circular at S-band and either right- or left-hand circular at
      X-band.  A Low-Gain Antenna (LGA) was mounted on the feed
      structure of the HGA and radiated approximately uniformly over
      the hemisphere into which the HGA pointed.  It was used during
      maneuvers, spacecraft anomalies, and at other times when the
      HGA was not appropriate.
 
      For receiving, the S-band HGA gain was 35 dB at 2115 MHz and the
      polarization was right-hand circular.  The receiving system
      noise temperature was approximately 2000 K, the carrier tracking
      loop bandwidth was 18 Hz, and the ranging channel noise
      bandwidth was 1.5 MHz.
 
    Operational Considerations
    ==========================
      Descriptions given here are for nominal performance.  The
      spacecraft transponder system comprised redundant units,
      each with slightly different characteristics.  As the
      transponder units ages, their performance changed slightly.
      More importantly, the performance for radio science depended
      on operational factors such as the modulation state for the
      transmitters, which cannot be predicted in advance.  The
      performance also depended on factors which were not always
      under the control of the Voyager Project.
 
      Spacecraft receivers were designed to lock to the uplink
      signal.  Without locking, Doppler effects -- resulting from
      relative motion of the spacecraft and ground station -- could
      result in loss of the radio link as the frequency of the
      received signal drifted.  A series of failures in the Voyager 2
      receivers left that transponder unable to track the uplink 
      signal.  Beginning in April 1978, Doppler shifts were predicted 
      and the uplink carrier was tuned so that Voyager 2 would see what
      appeared to be a signal at constant frequency (to an accuracy of 
      100 Hz.  There were no such problems with Voyager 1.
 
      During deep occultations by the giant planets, the bending angle
      resulting from refraction exceeded 10 degrees in some cases --
      well beyond the half power beamwidth of the spacecraft antenna.
      In those cases, the pointing of the HGA was adjusted so that
      it followed a &apos;virtual&apos; Earth and maximum signal strength could
      be sustained.  These &apos;limb-track&apos; maneuvers were critically
      dependent on accurate timing during the encounter.  To protect
      against Voyager 1 timing errors at Titan (primarily from
      uncertainties in the radius and position of the satellite),
      no limb-track was attempted during ingress, and a fixed
      antenna offset was used during egress.  Fortunately, timing was
      accurate enough that useful data were obtained from each event.
 
      Although the spacecraft radioisotope thermoelectric generators
      were not dependent on solar flux for power, their output decayed
      as the Voyager spacecraft moved outward through the solar
      system.  During encounters with the outer planets, caution was
      required in budgeting power and the high-power mode could not
      be used for the radio transmitters.
 
    Calibration Description
    =======================
      Prior to and during some encounter sequences, the spacecraft
      was commanded to execute a &apos;mini-ASCAL&apos; maneuver.  The HGA was
      moved slightly above the Earth line then slightly below the
      Earth line.  The procedure was repeated to the left and right
      of the Earth line so that a &apos;cross-hair&apos; pattern was mapped
      out.  During the maneuver, the amplitude of the carrier
      signal was measured carefully.  Analysis of the results
      showed whether the HGA was pointed accurately and, if not,
      allowed estimation of the error magnitude and direction.
 
      Prior to and after encounters, the spacecraft frequency
      reference was switched to the USO for several hours and the
      carrier signal was monitored using equipment at the DSN.
      These &apos;USO Tests&apos; were used to calibrate the frequency and
      frequency drift of the USO.  USO tests were particularly
      important before and after the spacecraft entered a severe
      radiation environment since the radiation typically damaged
      the crystal and changed its characteristics slightly.
 
    Platform Mounting Descriptions
    ==============================
      The centerline of the bus was the roll axis of the
      spacecraft; it also served as the z-axis of the spacecraft
      coordinate system with the high-gain antenna (HGA) boresight
      defining the negative z-direction.  The HGA boresight was
      also defined as cone angle 0 degrees and as azimuth 180
      degrees, elevation 7 degrees.  The Low-Gain Antenna (LGA)
      was mounted on the feed structure of the HGA and radiated
      approximately uniformly over the hemisphere into which the
      HGA pointed.
 
    Instrument Section / Operating Mode Descriptions
    ================================================
      The Voyager radio system consisted of two sections, which
      could be operated in the following modes:

    Instrument Description
    ======================
      The Voyager Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) is a modified
      version of the slow scan vidicon camera designs that were used
      in the earlier Mariner flights.  The system consists of two
      cameras, a high resolution Narrow Angle (NA) camera and a lower
      resolution, more sensitive Wide Angle (WA) camera.  Unlike the
      other on board instruments, operation of the cameras is not
      autonomous, but is controlled by an imaging parameter table
      residing in one of the spacecraft computers, the Flight Data
      Subsystem (FDS) (Science and Mission Systems Handbook, 1987,
      JPL D-498, an internal JPL document available from JPL vellum
      files).
 
      The original mission was to Jupiter and Saturn.  Voyager
      surpassed expectations and Voyager 2 went on to encounter
      Uranus and Neptune.  As the Voyager mission progressed the
      objects photographed were further from the sun so they appear
      more faint even though longer exposures were used.  As the
      Voyager spacecrafts&apos; distance from the Earth increases, the
      telecommunications capability at each encounter decreases.  The
      difference in capabilities from the Jupiter and Saturn
      encounters and that at Uranus and Neptune was considerable.
      The reduced telecommunications capability limits the number of
      data modes that imaging can use.  Because of the diminished
      brightness of the objects being photographed, longer exposure
      times were used, many beyond the stated maximum of 15.360
      seconds.  Longer exposure times were all 48-second increments
      added to the maximum.  In addition, the camera was slewed in
      order to avoid smeared imaging.  The light flood state (on/off)
      was independent of the instrument mode.
 
 
    Science Objectives
    ==================
      The overall objective of this experiment is exploratory
      reconnaissance of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and their
      satellites and rings.  Such reconnaissance, at resolutions and
      phase angles unobtainable from Earth, provides much new data
      relevant to the atmospheric and/or surface properties of these
      bodies.  The experiment also has the following specific
      objectives: observe and characterize global circulation and
      meteorology; determine the horizontal and vertical structure of
      visible clouds; characterize the nature of any colored material
      which may be in clouds.
 
 
    Operational Considerations
    ==========================
      To make full scientific use of the image collection it is
      necessary to understand the radiometric and geometric
      characteristics of the camera system and perform corrections to
      the data.
 
      Each Voyager camera is unique in terms of its calibrated
      characteristics.  Each has intrinsic shading (spatially
      non-uniform output DNs from flat field target) and exhibits
      barrel distortions typical of TV cameras flown on previous
      planetary missions.  Because of these characteristics, the
      cameras were calibrated before launch.  The response of the
      pixels to known targets, illumination, exposures, etc.  was
      measured and Calibration Files were generated to remove
      radiometric and geometric distortions from the flight images.
      These Calibration Files and detailed information on their use
      are available through the Imaging Node.
 
 
    Calibration Description
    =======================
      The calibration program for the Voyager television cameras
      consisted of three parts: (1) component calibrations; (&apos;Voyager
      Imaging Science Subsystem Calibration Report&apos; July 31, 1978, M.
      Benesh and P.  Jepsen, D-618-802) (2) subsystem calibrations;
      and, (3) system calibrations.  In addition, provision was made
      for in-flight calibrations.  Component calibrations were
      carried out prior to camera assembly.  Important measurements
      include spectral transmittance of the lens and filters, actual
      exposure times and shading characteristics of the shutter, and
      pertinent electro-optical properties of the vidicon.  After the
      optics and sensor were assembled it was possible to run
      calibrations at the camera, or subsystem, level.  Particular
      activities accomplished during this period included radiometric
      calibrations, focal length measurement, determination of the
      modulation transfer function, measurement of the geometric
      distortion, and calibrations required for color reconstruction.
      System calibrations were conducted after the cameras were
      installed on the spacecraft.  Important tasks included
      measurement of the Field-Of-View alignment and verification of
      the flat-field light transfer characteristics.  Noise
      measurements were also made at the system level.
 
      A method for in-flight verification of the radiometric
      calibrations that were run on the ground is employed on the
      Narrow-Angle optics.  It is very similar to the scheme used on
      the Wide-Angle optics except that eight lamps are required.
      They are located just within the field of view around the
      periphery of the telescope aperture.  By either pulsing the
      lamps or leaving them on and varying the shutter exposure time
      a transfer curve may also be generated by using the calibration
      plaque.  The method is identical to that described for the
      wide-angle optics.  However, calibration data was collected but
      no new calibration files were generated during the Jupiter,
      Saturn, or Uranus encounters or their related cruise periods.
 
      Although the INSTRUMENT_PARAMETER_NAME has been provided as
      Radiance, the Voyager Experiment Data Record (EDR) data set has
      not been radiometrically corrected, and thus images do not
      represent radiance units.  In order to convert an image from
      Data Number (DN) to radiance units, the image must be
      calibrated.  Radiometric calibration files, and selected
      radiometrically corrected images are available through the
      Imaging Node.

      Description
      -----------
        The sensor used in the Voyager - Imaging Science Subsystem
        (ISS) camera system is a 25-mm diameter magnetic and
        deflection vidicon (number B41-003, General Electro-dynamics
        Company).  The vidicon storage surface (target) is selenium
        sulphur and can store a high resolution (1500 TV lines)
        picture for over 100 s at room temperature.  The active image
        area on the target is 11.14 x 11.14 mm.  Each frame consists
        of 800 lines with 800 picture elements (pixels) per line,
        i.e., 1 pixel =14 microns.  One frame requires 48 s for
        electronic readout.  In addition to the normal frame readout
        of 48 s (1:1), four extended frame-time modes of 2:1, 3:1,
        5:1, and 10:1 are available by command.  Following readout,
        light flooding is used to remove any residual image that
        might remain from the previous frame.  At the end of light
        flooding, 14 erase frames are used to stabilize and prepare
        the vidicon target for the next exposure sequence (VGR ISS
        Calibration Report, 1978, an internal JPL document available
        from JPL vellum files).
 
 
      Sensitivity
      -----------
        Calibration experiments show the gain map indicating higher
        sensitivity toward the top of the frame in a generally radial
        manner.  Dark-current ratio results indicate a mean within
        plus-or-minus 3% of the true linearity of the light transfer
        function.  The required accuracy of the light-transfer
        functions was plus-or-minus 5% of half-scale signal averaged
        over any randomly selected area of 10 contiguous pixels.
        This requirement was consistently met for all Imaging Science
        Subsystem (ISS) flight cameras.  The radiance of the used
        light cannons was supposed to be plus-or-minus 5% or better
        of the level to produce a half-scale signal.  This criterion
        was also met.  It is not clear whether the color spatial
        dependence is due to the vidicon, or whether the filters have
        varying transmissions.  In the latter case, the ratios would
        be independent of light level; and this has been observed to
        be the case for all flight cameras.  Moreover, vidicons have
        not shown scale variations of this magnitude in the past, so
        that it is easier to believe that they are due to the
        spectral filters rather than to the vidicons.  The color
        sensitivity is sufficient to require a separate decalibration
        file for each spectral filter, which has been done, but not
        gross enough to cause concern about the quality of the image
        itself (VGR ISS Calibration Report, 1978, an internal JPL
        document available from JPL vellum files).

        The measurements recorded below are the coordinates
        representing the center of the Wide Angle Field Of View (FOV)
        in relation to the center of the Narrow Angle FOV.  As of
        5/26/88 the Voyager 2 scan platform offset values were
        updated and the removal of all extraneous offset values for
        VG1 and VG2 accomplished.  Only the most recently input
        values remain in the database for each spacecraft.  These
        values are effective for all periods of data inclusive from
        launch to present.  (June 7, 1989).

    Instrument Description
    ======================
      The Voyager Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) is a modified
      version of the slow scan vidicon camera designs that were used
      in the earlier Mariner flights.  The system consists of two
      cameras, a high resolution Narrow Angle (NA) camera and a lower
      resolution, more sensitive Wide Angle (WA) camera.  Unlike the
      other on board instruments, operation of the cameras is not
      autonomous, but is controlled by an imaging parameter table
      residing in one of the spacecraft computers, the Flight Data
      Subsystem (FDS) (Science and Mission Systems Handbook, 1987,
      JPL D-498, an internal JPL document available from JPL vellum
      files).
 
      The original mission was to Jupiter and Saturn.  Voyager
      surpassed expectations and Voyager 2 went on to encounter
      Uranus and Neptune.  As the Voyager mission progressed the
      objects photographed were further from the sun so they appear
      more faint even though longer exposures were used.  As the
      Voyager spacecrafts&apos; distance from the Earth increases, the
      telecommunications capability at each encounter decreases.  The
      difference in capabilities from the Jupiter and Saturn
      encounters and that at Uranus and Neptune was considerable.
      The reduced telecommunications capability limits the number of
      data modes that imaging can use.  Because of the diminished
      brightness of the objects being photographed, longer exposure
      times were used, many beyond the stated maximum of 15.360
      seconds.  Longer exposure times were all 48-second increments
      added to the maximum.  In addition, the camera was slewed in
      order to avoid smeared imaging.  The light flood state (on/off)
      was independent of the instrument mode.
 
 
    Science Objectives
    ==================
      The overall objective of this experiment is exploratory
      reconnaissance of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and their
      satellites and rings.  Such reconnaissance, at resolutions and
      phase angles unobtainable from Earth, provides much new data
      relevant to the atmospheric and/or surface properties of these
      bodies.  The experiment also has the following specific
      objectives: observe and characterize global circulation and
      meteorology; determine the horizontal and vertical structure of
      visible clouds; characterize the nature of any colored material
      which may be in clouds.
 
 
    Operational Considerations
    ==========================
      To make full scientific use of the image collection it is
      necessary to understand the radiometric and geometric
      characteristics of the camera system and perform corrections to
      the data.
 
      Each Voyager camera is unique in terms of its calibrated
      characteristics.  Each has intrinsic shading (spatially
      non-uniform output DNs from flat field target) and exhibits
      barrel distortions typical of TV cameras flown on previous
      planetary missions.  Because of these characteristics, the
      cameras were calibrated before launch.  The response of the
      pixels to known targets, illumination, exposures, etc.  was
      measured and Calibration Files were generated to remove
      radiometric and geometric distortions from the flight images.
      These Calibration Files and detailed information on their use
      are available through the Imaging Node.
 
 
    Calibration Description
    =======================
      The calibration program for the Voyager television cameras
      consisted of three parts: (1) component calibrations; (&apos;Voyager
      Imaging Science Subsystem Calibration Report&apos; July 31, 1978, M.
      Benesh and P.  Jepsen, D-618-802) (2) subsystem calibrations;
      and, (3) system calibrations.  In addition, provision was made
      for in-flight calibrations.  Component calibrations were
      carried out prior to camera assembly.  Important measurements
      include spectral transmittance of the lens and filters, actual
      exposure times and shading characteristics of the shutter, and
      pertinent electro-optical properties of the vidicon.  After the
      optics and sensor were assembled it was possible to run
      calibrations at the camera, or subsystem, level.  Particular
      activities accomplished during this period included radiometric
      calibrations, focal length measurement, determination of the
      modulation transfer function, measurement of the geometric
      distortion, and calibrations required for color reconstruction.
      System calibrations were conducted after the cameras were
      installed on the spacecraft.  Important tasks included
      measurement of the Field-Of-View alignment and verification of
      the flat-field light transfer characteristics.  Noise
      measurements were also made at the system level.
 
      A method for in-flight verification of the radiometric
      calibrations that were run on the ground is employed on the
      Narrow-Angle optics.  It is very similar to the scheme used on
      the Wide-Angle optics except that eight lamps are required.
      They are located just within the field of view around the
      periphery of the telescope aperture.  By either pulsing the
      lamps or leaving them on and varying the shutter exposure time
      a transfer curve may also be generated by using the calibration
      plaque.  The method is identical to that described for the
      wide-angle optics.  However, calibration data was collected but
      no new calibration files were generated during the Jupiter,
      Saturn, or Uranus encounters or their related cruise periods.
 
      Although the INSTRUMENT_PARAMETER_NAME has been provided as
      Radiance, the Voyager Experiment Data Record (EDR) data set has
      not been radiometrically corrected, and thus images do not
      represent radiance units.  In order to convert an image from
      Data Number (DN) to radiance units, the image must be
      calibrated.  Radiometric calibration files, and selected
      radiometrically corrected images are available through the
      Imaging Node.

      Description
      -----------
        The sensor used in the Voyager - Imaging Science Subsystem
        (ISS) camera system is a 25-mm diameter magnetic and
        deflection vidicon (number B41-003, General Electro-dynamics
        Company).  The vidicon storage surface (target) is selenium
        sulphur and can store a high resolution (1500 TV lines)
        picture for over 100 s at room temperature.  The active image
        area on the target is 11.14 x 11.14 mm.  Each frame consists
        of 800 lines with 800 picture elements (pixels) per line,
        i.e., 1 pixel =14 microns.  One frame requires 48 s for
        electronic readout.  In addition to the normal frame readout
        of 48 s (1:1), four extended frame-time modes of 2:1, 3:1,
        5:1, and 10:1 are available by command.  Following readout,
        light flooding is used to remove any residual image that
        might remain from the previous frame.  At the end of light
        flooding, 14 erase frames are used to stabilize and prepare
        the vidicon target for the next exposure sequence (VGR ISS
        Calibration Report, 1978, an internal JPL document available
        from JPL vellum files).
 
 
      Sensitivity
      -----------
        Calibration experiments show the gain map indicating higher
        sensitivity toward the top of the frame in a generally radial
        manner.  Dark-current ratio results indicate a mean within
        plus-or-minus 3% of the true linearity of the light transfer
        function.  The required accuracy of the light-transfer
        functions was plus-or-minus 5% of half-scale signal averaged
        over any randomly selected area of 10 contiguous pixels.
        This requirement was consistently met for all Imaging Science
        Subsystem (ISS) flight cameras.  The radiance of the used
        light cannons was supposed to be plus-or-minus 5% or better
        of the level to produce a half-scale signal.  This criterion
        was also met.  It is not clear whether the color spatial
        dependence is due to the vidicon, or whether the filters have
        varying transmissions.  In the latter case, the ratios would
        be independent of light level; and this has been observed to
        be the case for all flight cameras.  Moreover, vidicons have
        not shown scale variations of this magnitude in the past, so
        that it is easier to believe that they are due to the
        spectral filters rather than to the vidicons.  The color
        sensitivity is sufficient to require a separate decalibration
        file for each spectral filter, which has been done, but not
        gross enough to cause concern about the quality of the image
        itself (VGR ISS Calibration Report, 1978, an internal JPL
        document available from JPL vellum files).

        vidicon support circuits are the vertical and horizontal
        sweep circuits, and the various power supplies for the
        vidicon filament, and the focus and alignment coils.  The
        signal chain consists of the analog signal amplifiers,
        bandpass filters, and an eight bit analog-to-digital
        converter.  The digital output is sent to the Flight Data

        in relation to the center of the Narrow Angle FOV.  As of
        5/26/88 the Voyager 2 scan platform offset values were
        updated and the removal of all extraneous offset values for
        VG1 and VG2 accomplished.  Only the most recently input
        values remain in the database for each spacecraft.  These
        values are effective for all periods of data inclusive from
        launch to present.  (June 7, 1989).

    Instrument Description
    ======================
      The magnetic field experiment carried out on the Voyager 2
      mission consists of dual low field (LFM) and high field
      magnetometer (HFM) systems. The dual systems provide greater
      reliability and, in the case of the LFM&apos;s, permit the
      separation of the spacecraft magnetic fields from the ambient
      fields. Additional reliability is achieved through electronics
      redundancy. The wide dynamic ranges of +/- 0.002 G for the
      LFM&apos;s and +/- 20 G for the HFM&apos;s, low quantization uncertainty
      (+/- 12.4, 488 nanoTesla respectively), low sensor RMS noise
      level (0.006 nanoTesla), and the use of data compaction schemes
      to optimize the experiment information rate all combine to
      permit the study of a broad spectrum of phenomena during the
      mission.
 
    Science Objectives
    ==================
      The investigations of the magnetic fields and magnetospheres of
      the major planetary systems in the outer Solar System and their
      interactions with the solar wind are primary objectives of the
      space exploration program to be conducted during the Voyager 2
      mission. In addition, the investigation of the interplanetary
      magnetic field phenomena during the flights is of fundamental
      importance both to the understanding of the magnetospheric
      observations and to a number of outstanding questions in basic
      plasma physics and in the general dynamics of the solar wind.
      If the Heliospheric boundary is penetrated, accurate
      measurement of the interstellar magnetic field is also an
      important objective.
 
    Operational Considerations
    ==========================
      There are no special operational considerations for the
      magnetometer described in [BEHANNONETAL1977].
 
    Measured Parameters
    ===================
      The following LFM and HFM values are derived from Table 1 in
      [BEHANNONETAL1977].
 
      LFM Dynamic ranges and quantization uncertainty:
 
            Range (nT)               Quantization (nT)
         ----------------------------------------------
         1.  +/- 8.8                    +/- .0022
         2.  +/- 26                     +/- .0063
         3.  +/- 79                     +/- .019
         4.  +/- 240                    +/- .059
         5.  +/- 710                    +/- .173
         6.  +/- 2100                   +/- .513
         7.  +/- 6400                   +/- 1.56
         8.  +/- 50,000                 +/- 12.2
 
      HFM Dynamic ranges and quantization uncertainty:
 
            Range (nT)               Quantization (nT)
         ----------------------------------------------
         1.  +/- 5E+4                   +/- 12.3
         2.  +/- 2E+6                   +/- 488
 
    Calibration Description
    =======================
      The 13 meter Astromast booms have proved in extensive
      pre-flight testing to be highly rigid with respect to bending
      motions but soft to torsional or twisting motion. Deployment
      repeatability test have shown as much as +/- 7 degrees
      uncertainty in the knowledge of the boom twist angle (about the
      boom axis) at the magnetometer sensor positions, compared with
      +/- 0.5 uncertainty in bend angles (rotation about axes
      orthogonal to the boom axis). In order to minimize sensor
      alignment uncertainties, a method to estimate an angular
      correction matrix was developed that eliminates most of the
      twist uncertainty and some of the bend uncertainty. A special
      calibration coil has been wound around the periphery of the
      spacecraft&apos;s high gain antenna to generate, upon command, a
      known magnetic field at both LFM magnetometer sensors. The
      difference between measurements taken when the coil is turned
      on and off is the coil field, independent of all external
      fields. Using a 20 turn coil of 1/2 amp yields nominal field
      intensities 0f 33.4 and 6.1 nanoTesla at the inboard and
      outboard sensors, respectively. All magnetometer data are
      calibrated. Three types of in-flight calibrations are
      performed: 1) sensitivity calibrations, 2) zero-level
      calibrations, based on rolls of the spacecraft, and 3)
      boom-alignment calibrations based on the activation of on-board
      coils and resulting data (especially important when dual
      magnetometers are used and in strong fields for any
      magnetometer). Sensitivity calibrations (for 8 ranges) are
      done approximately once every two months (early in the mission
      they were done more frequently). The magnetometer team
      generally use one or two axis rolls (cruise maneuvers, CRSMR&apos;s)
      of the spacecraft for zero level calibrations as often as they
      are provided which is variable this is about three times per
      year for the so-called mini-CRSMR&apos;s, which are two axis rolls.
      Full CRSMR&apos;s and z-axis (only) roll-maneuvers have not occurred
      within the last few years (full CRSMR&apos;s and mini&apos;s differ only
      in the number of rolls in each). The magnetometer team usually
      succeeds in arguing for a series of rolls near each planetary
      encounter. Boom-alignment calibrations were done once after
      launch and around the time of the Jupiter encounter. Others
      have been executed, but it has been determined that the
      inter-sensor misalignment is small and constant. For more
      information, consult [BEHANNONETAL1977].
 
    LFM and HFM Detectors
    =====================
      Detector Type                  : RING CORE
      Detector Aspect Ratio          : 0.000000
      Nominal Operating Temperature  : 273.000000
 
      Total Fovs                     : 1

      Sample Bits                    : 12
 
      The magnetometer consists of 6 ring core detectors. These are
      designated as low field magnetometers (LFM) 1-3 and high field
      magnetometers (HFM) 1-3. The basic sampling rate is .06 +/-
      .006 seconds. Sampling rate for the high field system is .6
      seconds. The detectors measure in the interval of +/- 2.0E+6
      nT for HFM, and +/- 5.0E+4 for LFM. Nominal operating
      temperature for all detectors is 273 K, though the sensors
      were tested over a range of +/- 60 degrees about the nominal
      temperature.
 
      Both high and low field magnetometer sensors utilize a ring
      core geometry and thus have lower drive power requirements and
      better zero level stability than other types of fluxgates and
      are smaller in size [ACUNA1974]. The cores consist of an
      advanced molybdenum alloy, especially developed in cooperation
      with the Naval Surface Weapons Center, White Oak, Maryland,
      which exhibits extremely low noise and high stability
      characteristics. The use of this alloy and the ring core
      sensor geometry thus allows the realization of compact, low
      power, ultrastable fluxgate sensors with a noise performance
      that is improved almost an order of magnitude over the best
      previously flown fluxgate sensors. The HFM&apos;s use specially
      processed miniature ring cores (1 cm diameter) which minimize the
      power required to measure large fields. This description is
      taken directly from [BEHANNONETAL1977].

    Electronics
    ===========
    The instrument is composed of two completely redundant systems:
    the &apos;P&apos; or primary system and the &apos;S&apos; or secondary system.
 
    The experiment electronics instrumentation consists of the
    flux-gate magnetometer electronics and associated controls, and
    the calibration and data processing electronics. Complete
    redundancy is provided for the analog to digital converters,
    data and status readout buffers, command decoders and power
    converters. Thus not only can the two magnetometers of a
    system be interchanged, but considerable cross-strapping within
    the electronics permits interchange of critical internal
    functions as well. This significantly reduces the impact of
    single-component failure on the ability of the experiment to
    continue successful operation during the mission duration of
    &gt; 4 years. This description is directly transposed from
    [BEHANNONETAL1977] page 249.
 
    Operational Modes
    =================
    Data Path Type                 : REALTIME
    Instrument Power Consumption   : 2.200000
 
    In the CRUISE mode, only the LFM subsystem is operating.
    The basic sample rate in this mode is 50/3 vectors/second.
 
    In the ENCOUNTER mode, both LFM and HFM subsystems are
    operating. The basic sample rate in this mode is 50/3
    vectors/second for the LFM system and 5/3 vectors/second
    for the HFM system.
 
    Instrument Mounting
    ===================
    The LFM is located near the tip of the magnetometer boom and
    the HFM is located near the spacecraft body. See
    [BEHANNONETAL1977] for a picture of the actual magnetometer
    mounting positions and a complete description.

    Instrument Description
    ======================
      The magnetic field experiment carried out on the Voyager 2
      mission consists of dual low field (LFM) and high field
      magnetometer (HFM) systems. The dual systems provide greater
      reliability and, in the case of the LFM&apos;s, permit the
      separation of the spacecraft magnetic fields from the ambient
      fields. Additional reliability is achieved through electronics
      redundancy. The wide dynamic ranges of +/- 0.002 G for the
      LFM&apos;s and +/- 20 G for the HFM&apos;s, low quantization uncertainty
      (+/- 12.4, 488 nanoTesla respectively), low sensor RMS noise
      level (0.006 nanoTesla), and the use of data compaction schemes
      to optimize the experiment information rate all combine to
      permit the study of a broad spectrum of phenomena during the
      mission.
 
    Science Objectives
    ==================
      The investigations of the magnetic fields and magnetospheres of
      the major planetary systems in the outer Solar System and their
      interactions with the solar wind are primary objectives of the
      space exploration program to be conducted during the Voyager 2
      mission. In addition, the investigation of the interplanetary
      magnetic field phenomena during the flights is of fundamental
      importance both to the understanding of the magnetospheric
      observations and to a number of outstanding questions in basic
      plasma physics and in the general dynamics of the solar wind.
      If the Heliospheric boundary is penetrated, accurate
      measurement of the interstellar magnetic field is also an
      important objective.
 
    Operational Considerations
    ==========================
      There are no special operational considerations for the
      magnetometer described in [BEHANNONETAL1977].
 
    Measured Parameters
    ===================
      The following LFM and HFM values are derived from Table 1 in
      [BEHANNONETAL1977].
 
      LFM Dynamic ranges and quantization uncertainty:
 
            Range (nT)               Quantization (nT)

         2.  +/- 26                     +/- .0063
         3.  +/- 79                     +/- .019
         4.  +/- 240                    +/- .059

         7.  +/- 6400                   +/- 1.56
         8.  +/- 50,000                 +/- 12.2
 
      HFM Dynamic ranges and quantization uncertainty:
 
            Range (nT)               Quantization (nT)
         ----------------------------------------------
         1.  +/- 5E+4                   +/- 12.3
         2.  +/- 2E+6                   +/- 488
 
    Calibration Description
    =======================
      The 13 meter Astromast booms have proved in extensive
      pre-flight testing to be highly rigid with respect to bending
      motions but soft to torsional or twisting motion. Deployment
      repeatability test have shown as much as +/- 7 degrees
      uncertainty in the knowledge of the boom twist angle (about the
      boom axis) at the magnetometer sensor positions, compared with
      +/- 0.5 uncertainty in bend angles (rotation about axes
      orthogonal to the boom axis). In order to minimize sensor
      alignment uncertainties, a method to estimate an angular
      correction matrix was developed that eliminates most of the
      twist uncertainty and some of the bend uncertainty. A special
      calibration coil has been wound around the periphery of the
      spacecraft&apos;s high gain antenna to generate, upon command, a
      known magnetic field at both LFM magnetometer sensors. The
      difference between measurements taken when the coil is turned
      on and off is the coil field, independent of all external
      fields. Using a 20 turn coil of 1/2 amp yields nominal field
      intensities 0f 33.4 and 6.1 nanoTesla at the inboard and
      outboard sensors, respectively. All magnetometer data are
      calibrated. Three types of in-flight calibrations are
      performed: 1) sensitivity calibrations, 2) zero-level
      calibrations, based on rolls of the spacecraft, and 3)
      boom-alignment calibrations based on the activation of on-board
      coils and resulting data (especially important when dual
      magnetometers are used and in strong fields for any
      magnetometer). Sensitivity calibrations (for 8 ranges) are
      done approximately once every two months (early in the mission
      they were done more frequently). The magnetometer team
      generally use one or two axis rolls (cruise maneuvers, CRSMR&apos;s)
      of the spacecraft for zero level calibrations as often as they
      are provided which is variable this is about three times per
      year for the so-called mini-CRSMR&apos;s, which are two axis rolls.
      Full CRSMR&apos;s and z-axis (only) roll-maneuvers have not occurred
      within the last few years (full CRSMR&apos;s and mini&apos;s differ only
      in the number of rolls in each). The magnetometer team usually
      succeeds in arguing for a series of rolls near each planetary
      encounter. Boom-alignment calibrations were done once after
      launch and around the time of the Jupiter encounter. Others
      have been executed, but it has been determined that the
      inter-sensor misalignment is small and constant. For more

  Instrument Host Overview
  ========================
    For most Voyager experiments, data were collected by
    instruments on the spacecraft.  Those data were then relayed
    via the telemetry system to stations of the NASA Deep Space
    Network (DSN) on Earth.  Radio Science experiments (such as
    radio occultations) required that DSN hardware also participate
    in data acquisition.  The following sections provide an
    overview first of the spacecraft and then of the DSN ground
    system as both supported Voyager science activities.
 
 
  Instrument Host Overview - Spacecraft
  =====================================
    The Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft were identical and were
    built by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).  With a mass of
    815 kilograms, each carried its own power, propulsion, and
    communications systems and its own science instruments.
    Spacecraft electrical power was supplied by Radioisotope
    Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) that produced about 400 watts.
    The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS),
    Computer Command Subsystem (CCS), and Flight Data Subsystem
    (FDS) managed spacecraft operations.  Thrusters and gyros
    provided physical propulsion and attitude control.
    Communications between the spacecraft and Earth were carried
    out via a high-gain radio antenna using both S-band and X-band
    frequencies at data rates as high as 115.2 kilobits per second.
    A Digital Tape Recorder (DTR) could save up to 500 million bits
    when no Earth station was available for real-time data
    transmission.  Voyager control systems could record sets of
    several thousand instructions, allowing autonomous operation
    for days or weeks at a time.  More information on the
    spacecraft can be found in [MORRISON1982], [KOHLHASE1989], and
    [JPLPD618-128].
 
    The spacecraft itself was built around its &apos;bus&apos; -- a decagonal
    prism, which was about 2 meters in diameter and about 60 cm
    deep.  Each of the ten sides of the bus was associated with a
    &apos;bay&apos; containing engineering systems or science instrument
    electronics.  Bay 1, for example, contained the radio
    transmitter.  The High-Gain Antenna (HGA) was mounted to the
    end of the bus facing Earth.  The bays were numbered 1 through
    10 in a clockwise direction when viewed from Earth.  Extending
    away from the bus were three booms: a science boom and scan
    platform to which most instruments were mounted, a magnetometer
    boom, and a boom to which the RTGs were mounted.
 
 
    Spacecraft Coordinate System
    ----------------------------
      The centerline of the bus was the roll axis of the
      spacecraft; it also served as the z-axis of the spacecraft
      coordinate system with the high-gain antenna (HGA) boresight
      defining the negative z-direction.  The HGA boresight was
      also defined as cone angle 0 degrees and as azimuth 180
      degrees, elevation 7 degrees.  The science boom, supporting
      the scan platform, extended in the general direction of
      positive y; this boom was also defined as being at cone angle
      90 degrees, clock angle 215 degrees and at azimuth 180
      degrees, elevation 97 degrees.  A boom supporting the RTGs
      was mounted on the bus in generally the negative y direction.
      The positive y-axis (yaw axis) of the spacecraft coordinate
      system passed through Bay 3; the negative y-axis passed
      through Bay 8.  The x-axis (pitch axis) was in a direction
      which defined a right-handed rectangular coordinate system.
      The positive x-axis was at cone angle 90 degrees, clock angle
      305 degrees (azimuth 270 degrees, elevation 90 degrees).
 
 
    Telecommunications Subsystem
    ----------------------------
      The high-gain antenna was mounted to the spacecraft bus,
      pointing in the negative z-direction.  It was a parabolic
      reflector 3.7 meters in diameter with a feed that permitted
      simultaneous operation at both S-band (13 cm wavelength) and
      X-band (3.6 cm).  The half-power full-width of the antenna
      beam was 0.6 degrees at X-band and 2.3 degrees at S-band.
      The Low-Gain Antenna (LGA) was mounted on the feed structure
      of the HGA and radiated approximately uniformly over the
      hemisphere into which the HGA pointed.
 
      The Telecommunications Subsystem (TCS) electronics included a
      redundant pair of transponders, meaning that a failed
      functional unit in one transponder could be bypassed by
      swapping to the redundant unit.  The TCS could transmit
      science data on the X-band link at rates between 4.8 and
      115.2 kilobits per second and engineering data on the S-band
      link at 40 bits per second.  It could receive instructions
      sent (uplinked) from ground stations at a rate of 16 bits per
      second.  Commands were extracted from the uplink signal by
      the Command Detector Unit (CDU) and were then sent to the
      Computer Command Subsystem (CCS).
 
      Spacecraft receivers were designed to lock to the uplink
      signal.  Without locking, Doppler effects -- resulting from
      relative motion of the spacecraft and ground station -- could
      result in loss of the radio link as the frequency of the
      received signal drifted.  Unfortunately, a series of failures
      in the Voyager 2 receivers left that transponder unable to
      track the uplink signal.  Beginning in April 1978, Doppler
      shifts were predicted and the uplink carrier was tuned so
      that Voyager 2 would see what appeared to be a signal at
      constant frequency (to an accuracy of 100 Hz).
 
 
    Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem
    -------------------------------------------
      The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS)
      provided three-axis-stabilized control so that the spacecraft
      could maintain a fixed orientation in space.  Attitude
      control was accomplished using gyroscopes or by celestial
      reference.  The AACS also controlled motion of the scan
      platform, upon which the four &apos;remote sensing&apos; instruments
      were mounted.
 
      Gyro control was used in special situations (e.g., trajectory
      corrections and solar conjunctions) for periods of up to
      several days.  The inertial reference unit operated with
      tuned rotor gyros having an uncalibrated drift rate of less
      than 0.5 degrees per hour and a calibrated drift rate of less
      than 0.05 degrees per hour.
 
      Celestial control was based on viewing the Sun (through a
      sensor mounted on the high-gain antenna) and a single bright
      star (through a second sensor named the Canopus Star Tracker,
      after the star used most frequently as the reference).  When
      the spacecraft attitude drifted by more than a small amount
      from the reference objects, the AACS fired small thrusters
      which returned the spacecraft to the proper orientation.  The
      Sun sensor was an optical potentiometer with a cadmium
      sulfide detector; its error was less than 0.01 degrees and
      its limit cycle was +/-0.05 degrees.  The Canopus Star
      Tracker was an image dissector tube with a cesium detector,
      an error of less than 0.01 degree, and a limit cycle of
      +/-0.05 degrees.
 
      Redundant (backup) sun sensors, star trackers, and computers
      were also part of the AACS.  The non-redundant portions of
      the AACS were those controlling the pointing of the
      instrument scan platform, which had two degrees of freedom --
      elevation and azimuth (see below).
 
 
    Propulsion Subsystem
    --------------------
      The propulsion system was part of the AACS and consisted of
      16 hydrazine thrusters.  These thrusters were also used to
      control the three-axis stabilization of the spacecraft.  Two
      thrusters on opposite sides of the spacecraft were used to
      perform positive roll turns around the +Z axis.  Two
      oppositely pointed thrusters were used to perform negative
      roll turns.  One thruster was used to perform positive yaw
      turns (around the +Y axis) and one was used to perform
      negative yaw turns.  One thruster was used to perform
      positive pitch turns (around the +X axis) and one was used to
      perform negative pitch turns.  A backup hydrazine system was
      connected to a redundant set of eight thrusters.
 
 
    Power Subsystem
    ---------------
      Spacecraft power was provided by three Radioisotope
      Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) mounted on a boom in the
      negative y-direction.  At Launch the three RTGs converted
      7000 watts of heat into 475 watts of electrical power.  RTG
      electrical output decreased by about 7 watts per year because
      of decay of the plutonium dioxide fissionable material and
      degradation of the silicon-germanium thermocouples.  The
      difference between available electrical power and the power
      required to operate spacecraft subsystems was called the
      &apos;power margin.&apos; Voyager Project guidelines required a power
      margin of at least 12 watts to guard against electrical
      transients and miscalculations; excess electrical power was
      dissipated as heat in a shunt radiator.
 
 
    Data Storage Subsystem
    ----------------------
      The Digital Tape Recorder (DTR) was used to store data when
      real-time communications with Earth were either not possible
      or not scheduled.  The DTR recorded data on eight tracks;
      rates were 115.2 kilobits per second (record only), 21.6
      kilobits per second (playback only), and 7.2 kilobits per
      second (record and playback).  Capacity of each track was 12
      images or equivalent.
 
 
    Computer Command Subsystem
    --------------------------
      The Computer Command Subsystem (CCS) consisted of two
      identical computer processors, their software algorithms, and
      associated electronic hardware.  The CCS was the central
      controller of the spacecraft.  During most of the Voyager
      mission the two CCS computers on each spacecraft were used
      non-redundantly to increase the command and processing
      capability of the spacecraft.
 
 
    Flight Data Subsystem
    ---------------------
      The Flight Data Subsystem (FDS) consisted of two
      reprogrammable digital computers and associated encoding
      hardware.  The FDS collected and formatted science and
      engineering telemetry data for transmission to Earth.
      Convolutional coding was imposed on all data transmitted from
      the spacecraft.  Additionally, both Golay encoding and Reed-
      Solomon encoding were available for use on spacecraft data.
      Data compression was also performed within the FDS.
 
 
    Science Boom
    ------------
      The Voyager science instrument boom carried the plasma
      detector, cosmic ray detector and the low energy charged
      particle detector.  The scan platform was mounted on the
      science boom.
 
 
    Scan Platform
    -------------
      Four instruments (Imaging, PhotoPolarimeter, Infra-Red
      Interferometric Spectrometer, and Ultra Violet Spectrometer)
      were mounted on the scan platform, which could be slewed by
      motors and gears (called actuators).  Elevation of the scan
      platform was measured with respect to a plane slightly offset
      (by approximately 7 degrees) from the spacecraft x-z plane;
      the spacecraft positive y-axis was at 97 degrees elevation
      (see Spacecraft Coordinate System above).  The scan platform
      azimuth reference was defined by the y-z plane, with zero
      azimuth being in the negative z-direction.  Drive actuators
      were controlled by fine feedback potentiometers; the error of
      each was less than 0.03 degrees, and the final pointing error
      of the scan platform was nominally +/-0.1 degrees (2-sigma
      per axis).  Subsequent analysis by the Navigation and
      Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) at JPL has shown larger
      errors during at least the Jupiter and Saturn encounters.
      High rate slews of 1 deg/sec were discontinued after the
      azimuth drive mechanism on Voyager 2 temporarily froze a
      short time after Saturn closest approach.  The medium slew
      rate was 0.33 deg/sec, and the low slew rate was 0.08
      deg/sec.
 
 
    Magnetometer Boom
    -----------------
      Two low-field magnetometers were mounted on a 13-meter-long
      boom that was unfurled and extended automatically after
      Launch.  One low-field magnetometer was mounted at the end of
      the boom and a second was mounted about 3 meters from the
      end.  Two high-field magnetometers were mounted at the base
      of the boom.
 
 
    Science Sensors
    ---------------
      Each Voyager spacecraft carried instrumentation to support
      eleven science investigations.  Target body (or remote
      sensing) instruments included:
 
      (1) Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS)
      (2) Photopolarimeter Subsystem (PPS)
      (3) Infrared Radiometer Interferometer Spectrometer (IRIS)
      (4) Ultraviolet Spectrometer (UVS)
 
      Fields, waves, and particles (or in situ) sensors included:
 
      (1) Plasma Subsystem (PLS)
      (2) Low-Energy Charged Particle (LECP)
      (3) Cosmic-Ray Subsystem (CRS)
      (4) Magnetic Fields (MAG)
      (5) Plasma Wave Subsystem (PWS)
      (6) Planetary Radio Astronomy (PRA)
 
      The Radio Science (RSS) investigation was carried out using
      the on-board and ground elements of the Telecommunications
      Subsystem (TCS).  More information on instrumentation for
      each of the science investigations can be found elsewhere.
 
 
  Instrument Host Overview - DSN
  ==============================
    Voyager Radio Science investigations utilized instrumentation
    with elements on both the spacecraft and at ground stations of
    the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN).  Much of this was shared
    equipment, used for routine telecommunications as well as for
    Radio Science.
 
    The DSN is a telecommunications facility managed by the Jet
    Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology
    for NASA.  The primary function of the DSN is to provide
    two-way communications between the Earth and spacecraft
    exploring the solar system.  To carry out this function the DSN
    is equipped with high-power transmitters, low-noise amplifiers
    and receivers, and appropriate monitoring and control systems.
 
    During the Voyager era the DSN consisted of three complexes
    situated at approximately equally spaced longitudinal intervals
    around the globe at Goldstone (near Barstow, California),
    Robledo (near Madrid, Spain), and Tidbinbilla (near Canberra,
    Australia).  Two of the complexes are located in the northern
    hemisphere while the third is in the southern hemisphere.
 
    The network comprised several subnets, each of which included
    one antenna at each complex.  The subnets were defined
    according to the properties of their respective antennas.  Over
    the course of the Voyager Mission, those antennas were expanded
    and improved.  Nominal dimensions at the end (and beginning) of
    the Voyager Mission were: 70-m diameter (initially 64-m),
    standard 34-m diameter (initially 26-m), and high-efficiency
    34-m diameter (did not exist at beginning of Voyager).
 
    Additional ground equipment was provided by the Commonwealth
    Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) in
    Australia, the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science
    (ISAS) in Japan, and the National Radio Astronomy Observatory
    (NRAO) in the United States.  For the Voyager 2 encounters with
    Uranus and Neptune, the CSIRO 64-m diameter radio astronomy
    antenna near Parkes (Australia) was included in the receiving
    system for both telemetry and Radio Science.  For the Voyager 2
    encounter with Neptune, the ISAS 64-m diameter antenna near
    Usuda (Japan) was added for Radio Science and the NRAO Very
    Large Array (VLA) near Socorro (New Mexico) was added for
    telemetry.  The VLA consisted of 27 25-m antennas.  Parkes,
    Usuda, and the VLA were integrated with the permanent stations
    at Goldstone, Robledo, and Tidbinbilla by DSN personnel.

  Instrument Host Overview
  ========================
    For most Voyager experiments, data were collected by
    instruments on the spacecraft.  Those data were then relayed
    via the telemetry system to stations of the NASA Deep Space
    Network (DSN) on Earth.  Radio Science experiments (such as
    radio occultations) required that DSN hardware also participate
    in data acquisition.  The following sections provide an
    overview first of the spacecraft and then of the DSN ground
    system as both supported Voyager science activities.
 
 
  Instrument Host Overview - Spacecraft
  =====================================
    The Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft were identical and were
    built by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).  With a mass of
    815 kilograms, each carried its own power, propulsion, and
    communications systems and its own science instruments.
    Spacecraft electrical power was supplied by Radioisotope
    Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) that produced about 400 watts.
    The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS),
    Computer Command Subsystem (CCS), and Flight Data Subsystem
    (FDS) managed spacecraft operations.  Thrusters and gyros
    provided physical propulsion and attitude control.
    Communications between the spacecraft and Earth were carried
    out via a high-gain radio antenna using both S-band and X-band
    frequencies at data rates as high as 115.2 kilobits per second.
    A Digital Tape Recorder (DTR) could save up to 500 million bits
    when no Earth station was available for real-time data
    transmission.  Voyager control systems could record sets of
    several thousand instructions, allowing autonomous operation
    for days or weeks at a time.  More information on the
    spacecraft can be found in [MORRISON1982], [KOHLHASE1989], and
    [JPLPD618-128].
 
    The spacecraft itself was built around its &apos;bus&apos; -- a decagonal
    prism, which was about 2 meters in diameter and about 60 cm
    deep.  Each of the ten sides of the bus was associated with a
    &apos;bay&apos; containing engineering systems or science instrument
    electronics.  Bay 1, for example, contained the radio
    transmitter.  The High-Gain Antenna (HGA) was mounted to the
    end of the bus facing Earth.  The bays were numbered 1 through
    10 in a clockwise direction when viewed from Earth.  Extending
    away from the bus were three booms: a science boom and scan
    platform to which most instruments were mounted, a magnetometer
    boom, and a boom to which the RTGs were mounted.
 
 
    Spacecraft Coordinate System
    ----------------------------
      The centerline of the bus was the roll axis of the
      spacecraft; it also served as the z-axis of the spacecraft
      coordinate system with the high-gain antenna (HGA) boresight
      defining the negative z-direction.  The HGA boresight was
      also defined as cone angle 0 degrees and as azimuth 180
      degrees, elevation 7 degrees.  The science boom, supporting
      the scan platform, extended in the general direction of
      positive y; this boom was also defined as being at cone angle
      90 degrees, clock angle 215 degrees and at azimuth 180
      degrees, elevation 97 degrees.  A boom supporting the RTGs
      was mounted on the bus in generally the negative y direction.
      The positive y-axis (yaw axis) of the spacecraft coordinate
      system passed through Bay 3; the negative y-axis passed
      through Bay 8.  The x-axis (pitch axis) was in a direction
      which defined a right-handed rectangular coordinate system.
      The positive x-axis was at cone angle 90 degrees, clock angle
      305 degrees (azimuth 270 degrees, elevation 90 degrees).
 
 
    Telecommunications Subsystem
    ----------------------------
      The high-gain antenna was mounted to the spacecraft bus,
      pointing in the negative z-direction.  It was a parabolic
      reflector 3.7 meters in diameter with a feed that permitted
      simultaneous operation at both S-band (13 cm wavelength) and
      X-band (3.6 cm).  The half-power full-width of the antenna
      beam was 0.6 degrees at X-band and 2.3 degrees at S-band.
      The Low-Gain Antenna (LGA) was mounted on the feed structure
      of the HGA and radiated approximately uniformly over the
      hemisphere into which the HGA pointed.
 
      The Telecommunications Subsystem (TCS) electronics included a
      redundant pair of transponders, meaning that a failed
      functional unit in one transponder could be bypassed by
      swapping to the redundant unit.  The TCS could transmit
      science data on the X-band link at rates between 4.8 and
      115.2 kilobits per second and engineering data on the S-band
      link at 40 bits per second.  It could receive instructions
      sent (uplinked) from ground stations at a rate of 16 bits per
      second.  Commands were extracted from the uplink signal by
      the Command Detector Unit (CDU) and were then sent to the
      Computer Command Subsystem (CCS).
 
      Spacecraft receivers were designed to lock to the uplink
      signal.  Without locking, Doppler effects -- resulting from
      relative motion of the spacecraft and ground station -- could
      result in loss of the radio link as the frequency of the
      received signal drifted.  Unfortunately, a series of failures
      in the Voyager 2 receivers left that transponder unable to
      track the uplink signal.  Beginning in April 1978, Doppler
      shifts were predicted and the uplink carrier was tuned so
      that Voyager 2 would see what appeared to be a signal at
      constant frequency (to an accuracy of 100 Hz).
 
 
    Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem
    -------------------------------------------
      The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS)
      provided three-axis-stabilized control so that the spacecraft
      could maintain a fixed orientation in space.  Attitude
      control was accomplished using gyroscopes or by celestial
      reference.  The AACS also controlled motion of the scan
      platform, upon which the four &apos;remote sensing&apos; instruments
      were mounted.
 
      Gyro control was used in special situations (e.g., trajectory
      corrections and solar conjunctions) for periods of up to
      several days.  The inertial reference unit operated with
      tuned rotor gyros having an uncalibrated drift rate of less
      than 0.5 degrees per hour and a calibrated drift rate of less
      than 0.05 degrees per hour.
 
      Celestial control was based on viewing the Sun (through a
      sensor mounted on the high-gain antenna) and a single bright
      star (through a second sensor named the Canopus Star Tracker,
      after the star used most frequently as the reference).  When
      the spacecraft attitude drifted by more than a small amount
      from the reference objects, the AACS fired small thrusters
      which returned the spacecraft to the proper orientation.  The
      Sun sensor was an optical potentiometer with a cadmium
      sulfide detector; its error was less than 0.01 degrees and
      its limit cycle was +/-0.05 degrees.  The Canopus Star
      Tracker was an image dissector tube with a cesium detector,
      an error of less than 0.01 degree, and a limit cycle of
      +/-0.05 degrees.
 
      Redundant (backup) sun sensors, star trackers, and computers
      were also part of the AACS.  The non-redundant portions of
      the AACS were those controlling the pointing of the
      instrument scan platform, which had two degrees of freedom --
      elevation and azimuth (see below).
 
 
    Propulsion Subsystem
    --------------------
      The propulsion system was part of the AACS and consisted of
      16 hydrazine thrusters.  These thrusters were also used to
      control the three-axis stabilization of the spacecraft.  Two
      thrusters on opposite sides of the spacecraft were used to
      perform positive roll turns around the +Z axis.  Two
      oppositely pointed thrusters were used to perform negative
      roll turns.  One thruster was used to perform positive yaw
      turns (around the +Y axis) and one was used to perform
      negative yaw turns.  One thruster was used to perform
      positive pitch turns (around the +X axis) and one was used to
      perform negative pitch turns.  A backup hydrazine system was
      connected to a redundant set of eight thrusters.
 
 
    Power Subsystem
    ---------------
      Spacecraft power was provided by three Radioisotope
      Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) mounted on a boom in the
      negative y-direction.  At Launch the three RTGs converted
      7000 watts of heat into 475 watts of electrical power.  RTG
      electrical output decreased by about 7 watts per year because
      of decay of the plutonium dioxide fissionable material and
      degradation of the silicon-germanium thermocouples.  The
      difference between available electrical power and the power
      required to operate spacecraft subsystems was called the
      &apos;power margin.&apos; Voyager Project guidelines required a power
      margin of at least 12 watts to guard against electrical
      transients and miscalculations; excess electrical power was
      dissipated as heat in a shunt radiator.
 
 
    Data Storage Subsystem
    ----------------------
      The Digital Tape Recorder (DTR) was used to store data when
      real-time communications with Earth were either not possible
      or not scheduled.  The DTR recorded data on eight tracks;
      rates were 115.2 kilobits per second (record only), 21.6
      kilobits per second (playback only), and 7.2 kilobits per
      second (record and playback).  Capacity of each track was 12
      images or equivalent.
 
 
    Computer Command Subsystem
    --------------------------
      The Computer Command Subsystem (CCS) consisted of two
      identical computer processors, their software algorithms, and
      associated electronic hardware.  The CCS was the central
      controller of the spacecraft.  During most of the Voyager
      mission the two CCS computers on each spacecraft were used
      non-redundantly to increase the command and processing
      capability of the spacecraft.
 
 
    Flight Data Subsystem
    ---------------------
      The Flight Data Subsystem (FDS) consisted of two
      reprogrammable digital computers and associated encoding
      hardware.  The FDS collected and formatted science and
      engineering telemetry data for transmission to Earth.
      Convolutional coding was imposed on all data transmitted from
      the spacecraft.  Additionally, both Golay encoding and Reed-
      Solomon encoding were available for use on spacecraft data.
      Data compression was also performed within the FDS.
 
 
    Science Boom
    ------------
      The Voyager science instrument boom carried the plasma
      detector, cosmic ray detector and the low energy charged
      particle detector.  The scan platform was mounted on the
      science boom.
 
 
    Scan Platform
    -------------
      Four instruments (Imaging, PhotoPolarimeter, Infra-Red
      Interferometric Spectrometer, and Ultra Violet Spectrometer)
      were mounted on the scan platform, which could be slewed by
      motors and gears (called actuators).  Elevation of the scan
      platform was measured with respect to a plane slightly offset
      (by approximately 7 degrees) from the spacecraft x-z plane;
      the spacecraft positive y-axis was at 97 degrees elevation
      (see Spacecraft Coordinate System above).  The scan platform
      azimuth reference was defined by the y-z plane, with zero
      azimuth being in the negative z-direction.  Drive actuators
      were controlled by fine feedback potentiometers; the error of
      each was less than 0.03 degrees, and the final pointing error
      of the scan platform was nominally +/-0.1 degrees (2-sigma
      per axis).  Subsequent analysis by the Navigation and
      Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) at JPL has shown larger
      errors during at least the Jupiter and Saturn encounters.
      High rate slews of 1 deg/sec were discontinued after the
      azimuth drive mechanism on Voyager 2 temporarily froze a
      short time after Saturn closest approach.  The medium slew
      rate was 0.33 deg/sec, and the low slew rate was 0.08
      deg/sec.
 
 
    Magnetometer Boom
    -----------------
      Two low-field magnetometers were mounted on a 13-meter-long
      boom that was unfurled and extended automatically after
      Launch.  One low-field magnetometer was mounted at the end of
      the boom and a second was mounted about 3 meters from the
      end.  Two high-field magnetometers were mounted at the base
      of the boom.
 
 
    Science Sensors
    ---------------
      Each Voyager spacecraft carried instrumentation to support
      eleven science investigations.  Target body (or remote
      sensing) instruments included:
 
      (1) Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS)
      (2) Photopolarimeter Subsystem (PPS)
      (3) Infrared Radiometer Interferometer Spectrometer (IRIS)
      (4) Ultraviolet Spectrometer (UVS)
 
      Fields, waves, and particles (or in situ) sensors included:
 
      (1) Plasma Subsystem (PLS)
      (2) Low-Energy Charged Particle (LECP)
      (3) Cosmic-Ray Subsystem (CRS)
      (4) Magnetic Fields (MAG)
      (5) Plasma Wave Subsystem (PWS)
      (6) Planetary Radio Astronomy (PRA)
 
      The Radio Science (RSS) investigation was carried out using
      the on-board and ground elements of the Telecommunications
      Subsystem (TCS).  More information on instrumentation for
      each of the science investigations can be found elsewhere.
 
 
  Instrument Host Overview - DSN
  ==============================
    Voyager Radio Science investigations utilized instrumentation
    with elements on both the spacecraft and at ground stations of
    the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN).  Much of this was shared
    equipment, used for routine telecommunications as well as for
    Radio Science.
 
    The DSN is a telecommunications facility managed by the Jet
    Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology
    for NASA.  The primary function of the DSN is to provide
    two-way communications between the Earth and spacecraft
    exploring the solar system.  To carry out this function the DSN
    is equipped with high-power transmitters, low-noise amplifiers
    and receivers, and appropriate monitoring and control systems.
 
    During the Voyager era the DSN consisted of three complexes
    situated at approximately equally spaced longitudinal intervals
    around the globe at Goldstone (near Barstow, California),
    Robledo (near Madrid, Spain), and Tidbinbilla (near Canberra,
    Australia).  Two of the complexes are located in the northern
    hemisphere while the third is in the southern hemisphere.
 
    The network comprised several subnets, each of which included
    one antenna at each complex.  The subnets were defined
    according to the properties of their respective antennas.  Over
    the course of the Voyager Mission, those antennas were expanded
    and improved.  Nominal dimensions at the end (and beginning) of
    the Voyager Mission were: 70-m diameter (initially 64-m),
    standard 34-m diameter (initially 26-m), and high-efficiency
    34-m diameter (did not exist at beginning of Voyager).
 
    Additional ground equipment was provided by the Commonwealth
    Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) in
    Australia, the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science
    (ISAS) in Japan, and the National Radio Astronomy Observatory
    (NRAO) in the United States.  For the Voyager 2 encounters with
    Uranus and Neptune, the CSIRO 64-m diameter radio astronomy
    antenna near Parkes (Australia) was included in the receiving
    system for both telemetry and Radio Science.  For the Voyager 2
    encounter with Neptune, the ISAS 64-m diameter antenna near
    Usuda (Japan) was added for Radio Science and the NRAO Very
    Large Array (VLA) near Socorro (New Mexico) was added for
    telemetry.  The VLA consisted of 27 25-m antennas.  Parkes,
    Usuda, and the VLA were integrated with the permanent stations
    at Goldstone, Robledo, and Tidbinbilla by DSN personnel.

    Instrument Overview
    ===================
      The Voyager 2 Radio Science investigations at Neptune utilized
      instrumentation with elements both on the spacecraft and at
      the DSN.  Much of this was shared equipment, being used for
      routine telecommunications as well as for Radio Science.
      The performance and calibration of both the spacecraft and
      tracking stations directly affected the radio science data
      accuracy, and they played a major role in determining the
      quality of the results.  The spacecraft part of the radio
      science instrument is described immediately below; that is
      followed by a description of the DSN (ground) part of the
      instrument.
 
 
    Instrument Specifications - Spacecraft
    ======================================
      The Voyager 2 spacecraft telecommunications subsystem served
      as part of a radio science subsystem for investigations of
      Neptune.  Many details of the subsystem are unknown; its
      &apos;build date&apos; is taken to be 1977-08-20, which was the launch
      date for Voyager 2.

    Instrument Overview - Spacecraft
    ================================
      The spacecraft radio system was constructed around a redundant
      pair of transponders.  Each transponder was equipped with an
      S-band receiver (2115 MHz nominal frequency) and transmitters
      at both S-band (2295 MHz nominal) and X-band (8415 MHz nominal).
      Compared with S-band, X-band is less sensitive to plasma effects
      by a factor of about 10; use of both frequencies coherently on
      the &apos;downlink&apos; allowed estimation of plasma content along the
      radio path.  Use of X-band also significantly improved the
      quality of radio tracking data for gravity investigations.
 
      The transponder generated downlink signals in either &apos;coherent&apos;
      or &apos;non-coherent&apos; modes, also known as &apos;two-way&apos; and &apos;one-way,&apos;
      respectively.  When operating in the coherent mode, the
      transmitted carrier frequency was derived coherently from the
      received uplink carrier frequency with a &apos;turn-around ratio&apos; of
      240/221 at S-band and (11/3)*240/221 at X-band.
 
      In non-coherent mode the transmitted frequency was controlled
      by an on-board oscillator; the X- and S-band remained coherent
      in the ratio 11/3.  A single Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) was
      used during radio occultations; it provided stabilities
      several orders of magnitude better than the conventional
      crystal oscillators, which were part of each transponder.
 
      Stability of the Voyager 2 USO was specified in terms of its
      Allan Deviation -- the fractional frequency deviation from
      linear drift [ALLAN1966].  Over 10 minute periods, the Allan
      Deviation ranged from 10^-12 to 4 10^-12 for integrations of
      1-10 sec.  Long-term fractional drift of the oscillator was
      about 5 10^-11 per day.  Although the oscillator was hardened,
      there were discontinuities in the drift when the spacecraft
      passed through the radiation belts of the outer planets.  The
      equivalent microwave frequency of the USO at Voyager 2
      Jupiter occultation ingress was:
 
                     2,296,481,070.940 Hz (S-band)
                     8,420,430,593.447 Hz (X-band)
 
      Traveling wave tube or solid state amplifiers boosted the
      transponder output.  Output powers of 9 and 26  watts could
      be selected at S-band; the choices at X-band were 12 and 22
      watts.
 
      The signals were radiated via a 3.66 m diameter parabolic high
      gain antenna (HGA).  The HGA transmit boresight gain of
      the HGA was 36 dB at S-band and 47 dB at X-band.  The half-power
      half-width of the antenna beam was 0.32 degrees at X-band and
      1.1 degrees at S-band.  Transmit polarization was right-hand
      circular at S-band and either right- or left-hand circular at
      X-band.  A Low-Gain Antenna (LGA) was mounted on the feed
      structure of the HGA and radiated approximately uniformly over
      the hemisphere into which the HGA pointed.  It was used during
      maneuvers, spacecraft anomalies, and at other times when the
      HGA was not appropriate.
 
      For receiving, the S-band HGA gain was 35 dB at 2115 MHz and the
      polarization was right-hand circular.  The receiving system
      noise temperature was approximately 2000K, the carrier tracking
      loop bandwidth was 18 Hz, and the ranging channel noise
      bandwidth was 1.5 MHz.
 
      More information can be found in [ESHLEMANETAL1977].
 
 
    Science Objectives
    ==================
      Science objectives fell into two broad areas of investigation --
      those that could be met using high-precision radiometric data
      (sometimes known as &apos;tracking&apos; data) and those that could be met
      from studying characteristics of the radio signal after its
      interaction with an atmosphere, plasma, ring particles, or other
      intervening medium.  The tracking data were fundamental to
      inferring the gravitational forces on the spacecraft and
      relativistic effects along the radio path; both the measured
      time delay during a two-way transmission and the Doppler shift
      were used.  Investigators seeking knowledge of atmospheric
      structure, spatial and size distributions of ring particles,
      and velocity of the solar wind measured amplitude, frequency
      (and phase), and polarization of the radio signals which were
      captured by Earth receiving systems.  There are, of course,
      investigations which use both types of data.
 
 
      Gravity Measurements
      --------------------
        The frequency of the downlink carrier signal was precisely
        measured to determine the magnitude of the Doppler shift
        caused by acceleration of the spacecraft as it passed near
        either a single body or a system of bodies.  Since the
        magnitude of the Doppler shift is related to the gravitational
        field strength, the mass of the body (or bodies) can be
        determined.  If the radius of the body is known (as from
        calibrated images), the density can be calculated.
 
        Doppler and range tracking measurements yield accurate
        spacecraft trajectory solutions.  Simultaneously with
        reconstruction of the spacecraft orbit, observation equations
        for the central mass, low order coefficients for the field,
        and a small number of ancillary parameters can be solved.
        Measurements of the gravity field provide significant
        constraints on inferences about the interior structure of
        target bodies.
 
        The Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft came closer to Jupiter than
        Voyager, so there was no net improvement in the Jupiter mass
        estimate from Voyager.  But Voyager probed the Galilean
        satellites at closer range, and better mass estimates were
        obtained.  The Voyager encounters with Saturn, in conjunction
        with the close flyby of Pioneer 11, yielded a mass estimate
        comparable to that of Jupiter along with several low-order
        zonal harmonic coefficients.  Voyager 2 was targeted for a
        close encounter with Miranda, an inner satellite of Uranus;
        that, combined with long tracking arcs through the Uranian
        system, yielded the first good estimates of masses for the
        five largest satellites and an improved mass estimate for
        Uranus itself.  The Voyager 2 very close near-polar flyby
        with Neptune yielded estimates for the zonal harmonic
        coefficients J2 and J4 in addition to estimates for the mass
        of both Neptune and Triton.
 
 
      Atmospheric and Ionospheric Radio Occultation Measurements
      ----------------------------------------------------------
        Atmospheric measurements by the method of radio occultation
        contribute to an improved understanding of structure,
        circulation, dynamics, and transport in atmospheres of remote
        planetary bodies.  These results are based on detailed
        analysis of the radio signal received from the spacecraft as
        it enters and exits occultation by the planet.  Three phases
        of an atmospheric investigation may be defined.  The first is
        to obtain vertical profiles of atmospheric structure
        (temperature and pressure in the neutral atmosphere and
        electron density in the ionosphere) with emphasis on large-
        scale phenomena.  During this stage, it is necessary to know
        the mean molecular weight of the atmosphere; for Voyager
        the hydrogen-helium mixing ratio could be determined for each
        planet using the radio data in conjunction with Voyager IRIS
        data.  Second is to investigate absorption at various levels
        in the atmosphere -- such as by methane.  Third is to
        study details of the structure, such as result from
        propagation of buoyancy waves within a neutral atmosphere or
        from alignment of charged particles along magnetic field lines
        in an ionosphere.
 
        Retrieval of atmospheric profiles requires coherent
        samples of the radio signal that has propagated through
        the atmosphere, plus accurate knowledge of the antenna
        pointing and the spacecraft trajectory.  The spatial and
        temporal coverage in radio occultation experiments are
        determined by the observing geometry, including the spacecraft
        trajectory.  For deep atmospheres, changes in antenna pointing
        may be required to compensate for refractive bending by the
        atmosphere.  At Jupiter and Saturn both diametric and grazing
        occultations were obtained using the two Voyager spacecraft;
        measurements were obtained at both equatorial and polar
        latitudes.  Voyager 1 also obtained profiles for Titan.
        Voyager 2 continued to Uranus and Neptune, and also obtained
        occultation profiles at Triton.
 
 
      Radio Measurements on Planetary Rings
      -------------------------------------
        Radio occultation measurements of planetary rings are carried
        out using procedures similar to those employed for atmospheric
        occultations.  Although absorption by ring particles must be
        considered, the dominant effect on strength of the directly
        propagating signal is believed to be conservative scattering.
        Profiles of received signal strength can be inverted to yield
        the radial distribution of ring material.  Doppler spreading
        of the signal scattered in the near-forward direction can be
        used to infer the particle size distribution, especially when
        measurements at the two Voyager radio wavelengths are
        combined.
 
        Ring occultations were planned and observed at Saturn and
        Uranus.  Measurements were carried out at Neptune, but no
        rings or arcs were detected using the radio system.  A post-
        encounter search for a radio ring occultation at Jupiter was
        unsuccessful.
 
        Voyager 2 also carried out an oblique forward scattering
        experiment during its Saturn encounter.  The spacecraft high-
        gain antenna was deflected from the Earth direction so that
        it illuminated the ring system; but no scattered signal was
        detected.
 
 
      Solar Conjunction Experiments
      -----------------------------
        Solar conjunction experiments were conducted to improve
        understanding of the structure and dynamics of the solar
        corona and wind, to improve understanding of relativistic
        effects when radio waves propagate near the Sun, and to test
        the different elements of the radio science subsystem.
        Approximately once per year, each Voyager spacecraft appeared
        to pass behind the solar disk, as seen from Earth.  Radio
        waves propagating between Voyager and Earth stations were
        refracted and scattered (scintillation) by the solar plasma
        [WOO1993].  Intensity fluctuations can be related to
        fluctuations in electron density along the path, while Doppler
        or phase scintillations can be related to both electron
        density fluctuations and also the speed of the solar wind.
        Many plasma effects decrease as the square of the radio
        frequency; plasma effects are about an order of magnitude
        stronger at S-band than X-band.
 
 
      Experimental Relativity
      -----------------------
        The gravitational field of the Sun causes a time delay on
        signals that propagate near the Sun of approximately 300
        microseconds.  Although previous tests had verified the effect
        to an accuracy of a few percent, Voyager measurements could
        be conducted annually and at two frequencies, allowing
        separation of plasma effects.
 
        Gravitational fields of the gas giant planets also affected
        radio signals by causing them to have apparent frequencies
        lower than predicted.  The change in frequency is related to
        the mass of the planet.  By measuring the change in frequency
        as the spacecraft approached the planet, a value for the mass
        could be calculated.  This value could then be compared with
        the mass derived from two-way tracking data.  The spacecraft
        Ultra-Stable Oscillator was used for these measurements;
        two-way transmissions have nearly canceling frequency shifts
        as the signal travels to the spacecraft and then returns.  The
        dual frequencies available from Voyager allowed correction for
        plasma effects along the radio path, but calibration for
        radiation damage to the USO during encounters was more
        difficult.
 
 
    Operational Considerations - Spacecraft
    =======================================
      Descriptions given here are for nominal performance.  The
      spacecraft transponder system comprised redundant units,
      each with slightly different characteristics.  As
      transponder units age, their performance changes slightly.
      More importantly, the performance for radio science depended
      on operational factors such as the modulation state for the
      transmitters, which cannot be predicted in advance.  The
      performance also depended on factors which were not always
      under the control of the Voyager Project.
 
      Spacecraft receivers were designed to lock to the uplink
      signal.  Without locking, Doppler effects -- resulting from
      relative motion of the spacecraft and ground station -- could
      result in loss of the radio link as the frequency of the
      received signal drifted.  Unfortunately, a series of failures
      in the Voyager 2 receivers left that transponder unable to
      track the uplink signal.  Beginning in April 1978, Doppler
      shifts were predicted and the uplink carrier was tuned so
      that Voyager 2 would see what appeared to be a signal at
      constant frequency (to an accuracy of 100 Hz).
 
      During deep occultations by the giant planets, the bending angle
      resulting from refraction exceeded 10 degrees in some cases --
      well beyond the half power beamwidth of the spacecraft antenna.
      In those cases, the pointing of the HGA was adjusted so that
      it followed a &apos;virtual&apos; Earth and maximum signal strength could
      be sustained.  These &apos;limb-track&apos; maneuvers were critically
      dependent on accurate timing in the encounter.  To protect
      against timing errors at Titan (primarily from uncertaintes in
      the radius and position of the satellite), no limb-track was
      attempted during ingress while a fixed antenna offset was used
      during egress.
 
      Although the spacecraft radioisotope thermoelectric generators
      were not dependent on solar flux for power, their output decayed
      as the Voyager spacecraft moved outward through the solar
      system.  During encounters with the outer planets, caution was
      required in budgeting power and the high-power mode could not
      be used for the radio transmitters.
 
 
    Calibration Description - Spacecraft
    ====================================
      Prior to and during some encounter sequences, the spacecraft
      was commanded to execute a &apos;mini-azcal&apos; maneuver.  The HGA was
      moved slightly above the Earth line then slightly below the
      Earth line.  The procedure was repeated to the left and right
      of the Earth line so that a &apos;cross-hair&apos; pattern was mapped
      out.  During the maneuver, the amplitude of the carrier
      signal was measured carefully.  Analysis of the results would
      show whether the HGA was pointed accurately and, if not,
      approximately the error and direction.
 
      Prior to and after encounters, the spacecraft frequency
      reference was switched to the USO for several hours and the
      carrier signal was monitored using equipment at the DSN.
      These &apos;USO Tests&apos; were used to calibrate the frequency and
      frequency drift of the USO.  USO tests were particularly
      important before and after the spacecraft entered a severe
      radiation environment since the radiation typically damaged
      the crystal and changed its characteristics slightly.
 
 
    Platform Mounting Descriptions - Spacecraft
    ===========================================
      The centerline of the bus was the roll axis of the
      spacecraft; it also served as the z-axis of the spacecraft
      coordinate system with the high-gain antenna (HGA) boresight
      defining the negative z-direction.  The HGA boresight was
      also defined as cone angle 0 degrees and as azimuth 180
      degrees, elevation 7 degrees.  The Low-Gain Antenna (LGA)
      was mounted on the feed structure of the HGA and radiated
      approximately uniformly over the hemisphere into which the
      HGA pointed.
 
 
    Principal Investigators
    =======================
      The Radio Science Team Leader through the Jupiter encounters
      was Von R. Eshleman.  The Team Leader for the Saturn, Uranus,
      and Neptune encounters was G. Leonard Tyler.

    Instrument Overview - DSN
    =========================
      Three Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs) (near
      Barstow, CA; Canberra, Australia; and Madrid, Spain) comprise
      the DSN tracking network.  Each complex is equipped with
      several antennas [including at least one each 70-m, 34-m High
      Efficiency (HEF), and 34-m standard (STD)], associated
      electronics, and operational systems.  Primary activity at each
      complex is radiation of commands to and reception of telemetry
      data from active spacecraft.  Transmission and reception is
      possible in several radio-frequency bands, the most common
      being S-band (nominally a frequency of 2100-2300 MHz or a
      wavelength of 14.2-13.0 cm) and X-band (7100-8500 MHz or 4.2-
      3.5 cm).  Transmitter output powers of up to 400 kw are
      available.
 
      Ground stations have the ability to transmit coded and uncoded
      waveforms which can be echoed by distant spacecraft.  Analysis
      of the received coding allows navigators to determine the
      distance to the spacecraft; analysis of Doppler shift on the
      carrier signal allows estimation of the line-of-sight
      spacecraft velocity.  Range and Doppler measurements are used
      to calculate the spacecraft trajectory and to infer gravity
      fields of objects near the spacecraft.
 
      Ground stations can record spacecraft signals that have
      propagated through or been scattered from target media.
      Measurements of signal parameters after wave interactions with
      surfaces, atmospheres, rings, and plasmas are used to infer
      physical and electrical properties of the target.
 
      Principal investigators vary from experiment to experiment.
      See the corresponding section of the spacecraft instrument
      description or the data set description for specifics.
 
      The Deep Space Network is managed by the Jet Propulsion
      Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology for the
      U.S.  National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

    Subsystems - DSN
    ================
      The Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs) are an integral
      part of the Radio Science instrument, along with other
      receiving stations and the spacecraft Radio Frequency
      Subsystem.  Their system performance directly determines the
      degree of success of Radio Science investigations, and their
      system calibration determines the degree of accuracy in the
      results of the experiments.  The following paragraphs describe
      the functions performed by the individual subsystems of a DSCC.
      This material has been adapted from [ASMAR&amp;HERRERA1993]; for
      additional information, consult [DSN810-5].
 
      Each DSCC includes a set of antennas, a Signal Processing
      Center (SPC), and communication links to the Jet Propulsion
      Laboratory (JPL).  The general configuration is illustrated
      below; antennas (Deep Space Stations, or DSS -- a term carried
      over from earlier times when antennas were individually
      instrumented) are listed in the table.

      DSCC Monitor and Control Subsystem
      ----------------------------------
        The DSCC Monitor and Control Subsystem (DMC) is part of the
        Monitor and Control System (MON) which also includes the
        ground communications Central Communications Terminal and the
        Network Operations Control Center (NOCC) Monitor and Control
        Subsystem.  The DMC is the center of activity at a DSCC.  The
        DMC receives and archives most of the information from the
        NOCC needed by the various DSCC subsystems during their
        operation.  Control of most of the DSCC subsystems, as well
        as the handling and displaying of any responses to control
        directives and configuration and status information received
        from each of the subsystems, is done through the DMC.  The
        effect of this is to centralize the control, display, and
        archiving functions necessary to operate a DSCC.
        Communication among the various subsystems is done using a
        Local Area Network (LAN) hooked up to each subsystem via a
        network interface unit (NIU).
 
        DMC operations are divided into two separate areas: the
        Complex Monitor and Control (CMC) and the Link Monitor and
        Control (LMC).  The primary purpose of the CMC processor for
        Radio Science support is to receive and store all predict
        sets transmitted from NOCC such as Radio Science, antenna
        pointing, tracking, receiver, and uplink predict sets and
        then, at a later time, to distribute them to the appropriate
        subsystems via the LAN.  Those predict sets can be stored in
        the CMC for a maximum of three days under normal conditions.
        The CMC also receives, processes, and displays event/alarm
        messages; maintains an operator log; and produces tape labels
        for the DSP.  Assignment and configuration of the LMCs is
        done through the CMC; to a limited degree the CMC can perform
        some of the functions performed by the LMC.  There are two
        CMCs (one on-line and one backup) and three LMCs at each DSCC
        The backup CMC can function as an additional LMC if
        necessary.
 
        The LMC processor provides the operator interface for monitor
        and control of a link -- a group of equipment required to
        support a spacecraft pass.  For Radio Science, a link might
        include the DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP) (which,
        in turn, can control the SSI), or the Tracking Subsystem.
        The LMC also maintains an operator log which includes
        operator directives and subsystem responses.  One important
        Radio Science specific function that the LMC performs is
        receipt and transmission of the system temperature and signal
        level data from the PPM for display at the LMC console and
        for inclusion in Monitor blocks.  These blocks are recorded
        on magnetic tape as well as appearing in the Mission Control
        and Computing Center (MCCC) displays.  The LMC is required to
        operate without interruption for the duration of the Radio
        Science data acquisition period.
 
        The Area Routing Assembly (ARA), which is part of the Digital
        Communications Subsystem, controls all data communication
        between the stations and JPL.  The ARA receives all required
        data and status messages from the LMC/CMC and can record them
        to tape as well as transmit them to JPL via data lines.  The
        ARA also receives predicts and other data from JPL and passes
        them on to the CMC.
 
 
      DSCC Antenna Mechanical Subsystem
      ---------------------------------
        Multi-mission Radio Science activities require support from
        the 70-m, 34-m HEF, and 34-m STD antenna subnets.  The
        antennas at each DSCC function as large-aperture collectors
        which, by double reflection, cause the incoming radio
        frequency (RF) energy to enter the feed horns.  The large
        collecting surface of the antenna focuses the incoming energy
        onto a subreflector, which is adjustable in both axial and
        angular position.  These adjustments are made to correct for
        gravitational deformation of the antenna as it moves between
        zenith and the horizon; the deformation can be as large as
        5 cm.  The subreflector adjustments optimize the channeling
        of energy from the primary reflector to the subreflector
        and then to the feed horns.  The 70-m and 34-m HEF antennas
        have &apos;shaped&apos; primary and secondary reflectors, with forms
        that are modified paraboloids.  This customization allows
        more uniform illumination of one reflector by another.  The
        34-m STD primary reflectors are classical paraboloids, while
        the subreflectors are standard hyperboloids.
 
        On the 70-m and 34-m STD antennas, the subreflector directs
        received energy from the antenna onto a dichroic plate, a
        device which reflects S-band energy to the S-band feed horn
        and passes X-band energy through to the X-band feed horn.  In
        the 34-m HEF, there is one &apos;common aperture feed,&apos; which
        accepts both frequencies without requiring a dichroic plate.
        RF energy to be transmitted into space by the horns is
        focused by the reflectors into narrow cylindrical beams,
        pointed with high precision (either to the dichroic plate or
        directly to the subreflector) by a series of drive motors and
        gear trains that can rotate the movable components and their
        support structures.
 
        The different antennas can be pointed by several means.  Two
        pointing modes commonly used during tracking passes are
        CONSCAN and &apos;blind pointing.&apos; With CONSCAN enabled and a
        closed loop receiver locked to a spacecraft signal, the
        system tracks the radio source by conically scanning around
        its position in the sky.  Pointing angle adjustments are
        computed from signal strength information (feedback) supplied
        by the receiver.  In this mode the Antenna Pointing Assembly
        (APA) generates a circular scan pattern which is sent to the
        Antenna Control System (ACS).  The ACS adds the scan pattern
        to the corrected pointing angle predicts.  Software in the
        receiver-exciter controller computes the received signal
        level and sends it to the APA.  The correlation of scan
        position with the received signal level variations allows the
        APA to compute offset changes which are sent to the ACS.
        Thus, within the capability of the closed-loop control
        system, the scan center is pointed precisely at the apparent
        direction of the spacecraft signal source.  An additional
        function of the APA is to provide antenna position angles and
        residuals, antenna control mode/status information, and
        predict-correction parameters to the Area Routing Assembly
        (ARA) via the LAN, which then sends this information to JPL
        via the Ground Communications Facility (GCF) for antenna
        status monitoring.
 
        During periods when excessive signal level dynamics or low
        received signal levels are expected (e.g., during an
        occultation experiment), CONSCAN should not be used.  Under
        these conditions, blind pointing (CONSCAN OFF) is used, and
        pointing angle adjustments are based on a predetermined
        Systematic Error Correction (SEC) model.
 
        Independent of CONSCAN state, subreflector motion in at least
        the z-axis may introduce phase variations into the received
        Radio Science data.  For that reason, during certain
        experiments, the subreflector in the 70-m and 34-m HEFs may
        be frozen in the z-axis at a position (often based on
        elevation angle) selected to minimize phase change and signal
        degradation.  This can be done via Operator Control Inputs
        (OCIs) from the LMC to the Subreflector Controller (SRC)
        which resides in the alidade room of the antennas.  The SRC
        passes the commands to motors that drive the subreflector to
        the desired position.  Unlike the 70-m and 34-m HEFs which
        have azimuth-elevation (AZ-EL) drives, the 34-m STD antennas
        use (hour angle-declination) HA-DEC drives.  The same
        positioning of the subreflector on the 34-m STD does not
        create the same effect as on the 70-m and 34-m HEFs.
 
        Pointing angles for all three antenna types are computed by
        the NOCC Support System (NSS) from an ephemeris provided by
        the flight project.  These predicts are received and archived
        by the CMC.  Before each track, they are transferred to the
        APA, which transforms the direction cosines of the predicts
        into AZ-EL coordinates for the 70-m and 34-m HEFs or into
        HA-DEC coordinates for the 34-m STD antennas.  The LMC
        operator then downloads the antenna AZ-EL or HA-DEC predict
        points to the antenna-mounted ACS computer along with a
        selected SEC model.  The pointing predicts consist of
        time-tagged AZ-EL or HA-DEC points at selected time intervals
        along with polynomial coefficients for interpolation between
        points.
 
        The ACS automatically interpolates the predict points,
        corrects the pointing predicts for refraction and
        subreflector position, and adds the proper systematic error
        correction and any manually entered antenna offsets.  The ACS
        then sends angular position commands for each axis at the
        rate of one per second.  In the 70-m and 34-m HEF, rate
        commands are generated from the position commands at the
        servo controller and are subsequently used to steer the
        antenna.  In the 34-m STD antennas motors, rather than
        servos, are used to steer the antenna; there is no feedback
        once the 34-m STD has been told where to point.
 
        When not using binary predicts (the routine mode for
        spacecraft tracking), the antennas can be pointed using
        &apos;planetary mode&apos; -- a simpler mode which uses right ascension
        (RA) and declination (DEC) values.  These change very slowly
        with respect to the celestial frame.  Values are provided to
        the station in text form for manual entry.  The ACS
        quadratically interpolates among three RA and DEC points
        which are on one-day centers.
 
        A third pointing mode -- sidereal -- is available for
        tracking radio sources fixed with respect to the celestial
        frame.
 
        Regardless of the pointing mode being used, a 70-m antenna
        has a special high-accuracy pointing capability called
        &apos;precision&apos; mode.  A pointing control loop derives the
        main AZ-EL pointing servo drive error signals from a two-
        axis autocollimator mounted on the Intermediate Reference
        Structure.  The autocollimator projects a light beam to a
        precision mirror mounted on the Master Equatorial drive
        system, a much smaller structure, independent of the main
        antenna, which is exactly positioned in HA and DEC with shaft
        encoders.  The autocollimator detects elevation/cross-
        elevation errors between the two reference surfaces by
        measuring the angular displacement of the reflected light
        beam.  This error is compensated for in the antenna servo by
        moving the antenna in the appropriate AZ-EL direction.
        Pointing accuracies of 0.004 degrees (15 arc seconds) are
        possible in &apos;precision&apos; mode.  The &apos;precision&apos; mode is not
        available on 34-m antennas -- nor is it needed, since their
        beamwidths are twice as large as on the 70-m antennas.
 
 
      DSCC Antenna Microwave Subsystem
      --------------------------------
        70-m Antennas: Each 70-m antenna has three feed cones
        installed in a structure at the center of the main reflector.
        The feeds are positioned 120 degrees apart on a circle.
        Selection of the feed is made by rotation of the
        subreflector.  A dichroic mirror assembly, half on the S-band
        cone and half on the X-band cone, permits simultaneous use of
        the S- and X-band frequencies.  The third cone is devoted to
        R&amp;D and more specialized work.
 
        The Antenna Microwave Subsystem (AMS) accepts the received S-
        and X-band signals at the feed horn and transmits them
        through polarizer plates to an orthomode transducer.  The
        polarizer plates are adjusted so that the signals are
        directed to a pair of redundant amplifiers for each
        frequency, thus allowing simultaneous reception of signals in
        two orthogonal polarizations.  For S-band these are two Block
        IVA S-band Traveling Wave Masers (TWMs); for X-band the
        amplifiers are Block IIA TWMs.
 
        34-m STD Antennas: These antennas have two feed horns, one
        for S-band signals and one for X-band.  The horns are mounted
        on a cone which is fixed in relation to the subreflector.  A
        dichroic plate mounted above the horns directs energy from
        the subreflector into the proper horn.
 
        The AMS directs the received S- and X-band signals through
        polarizer plates and on to amplification.  There are two
        Block III S-band TWMs and two Block I X-band TWMs.
 
        34-m HEF Antennas: Unlike the other antennas, the 34-m HEF
        uses a single feed for both S- and X-band.  Simultaneous S-
        and X-band receive as well as X-band transmit is possible
        thanks to the presence of an S/X &apos;combiner&apos; which acts as a
        diplexer.  For S-band, RCP or LCP is user selected through a
        switch so neither a polarizer nor an orthomode transducer is
        needed.  X-band amplification options include two Block II
        TWMs or an HEMT Low Noise Amplifier (LNA).  S-band
        amplification is provided by an FET LNA.
 
 
      DSCC Receiver-Exciter Subsystem
      -------------------------------
        The Receiver-Exciter Subsystem is composed of three groups of
        equipment: the closed-loop receiver group, the open-loop
        receiver group, and the RF monitor group.  This subsystem is
        controlled by the Receiver-Exciter Controller (REC) which
        communicates directly with the DMC for predicts and OCI
        reception and status reporting.
 
        The exciter generates the S-band signal (or X-band for the
        34-m HEF only) which is provided to the Transmitter Subsystem
        for the spacecraft uplink signal.  It is tunable under
        command of the Digitally Controlled Oscillator (DCO) which
        receives predicts from the Metric Data Assembly (MDA).
 
        The diplexer in the signal path between the transmitter and
        the feed horn for all three antennas (used for simultaneous
        transmission and reception) may be configured such that it is
        out of the received signal path (in listen-only or bypass
        mode) in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the
        receiver system.
 
        Closed Loop Receivers: The Block IV receiver-exciter at the
        70-m stations allows for two receiver channels, each capable
        of L-Band (e.g., 1668 MHz frequency or 18 cm wavelength),
        S-band, or X-band reception, and an S-band exciter for
        generation of uplink signals through the low-power or
        high-power transmitter.  The Block III receiver-exciter at
        the 34-m STD stations allows for two receiver channels, each
        capable of S-band or X-band reception and an exciter used to
        generate an uplink signal through the low-power transmitter.
        The receiver-exciter at the 34-m HEF stations allows for one
        channel only.
 
        The closed-loop receivers provide the capability for rapid
        acquisition of a spacecraft signal and telemetry lockup.  In
        order to accomplish acquisition within a short time, the
        receivers are predict driven to search for, acquire, and
        track the downlink automatically.  Rapid acquisition
        precludes manual tuning though that remains as a backup
        capability.  The subsystem utilizes FFT analyzers for rapid
        acquisition.  The predicts are NSS generated, transmitted to
        the CMC which sends them to the Receiver-Exciter Subsystem
        where two sets can be stored.  The receiver starts
        acquisition at uplink time plus one round-trip-light-time or
        at operator specified times.  The receivers may also be
        operated from the LMC without a local operator attending
        them.  The receivers send performance and status data,
        displays, and event messages to the LMC.
 
        Either the exciter synthesizer signal or the simulation
        (SIM) synthesizer signal is used as the reference for the
        Doppler extractor in the closed-loop receiver systems,
        depending on the spacecraft being tracked (and Project
        guidelines).  The SIM synthesizer is not ramped; instead it
        uses one constant frequency, the Track Synthesizer Frequency
        (TSF), which is an average frequency for the entire pass.
 
        The closed-loop receiver AGC loop can be configured to one of
        three settings: narrow, medium, or wide.  It will be
        configured such that the expected amplitude changes are
        accommodated with minimum distortion.  The loop bandwidth
        (2BLo) will be configured such that the expected phase
        changes can be accommodated while maintaining the best
        possible loop SNR.
 
        Open-Loop Receivers: There are two types of Radio Science
        Open-Loop Receivers (OLR) in use.  At 70-m and 34-m HEF
        stations the OLR is a dedicated four channel, narrow-band
        receiver which provides amplified and downconverted video band
        signals to the DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP); it
        sometimes goes by the designation &apos;RIV&apos;.  At 34-m STD stations
        (DSS 42 and DSS 61) the OLR is an older system, the Multi-
        Mission Receiver (MMR), which provides two channels of narrow-
        band receiver output.  Both OLR systems are described in
        detail below under &apos;Electronics - DSN&apos;; here the overview
        continues only for the RIV system.
 
        The 70-m and 34-m HEF OLR utilizes a fixed first Local
        Oscillator (LO) frequency and a tunable second LO frequency
        to minimize phase noise and improve frequency stability.
        The OLR consists of an RF-to-IF downconverter located in
        the antenna, an IF selection switch (IVC), and a Radio
        Science IF-VF downconverter (RIV) located in the SPC.
        The RF-IF downconverters in the 70-m antennas are equipped
        for four IF channels: S-RCP, S-LCP, X-RCP, and X-LCP.  The
        34-m HEF stations are equipped with a two-channel RF-IF:
        S-band and X-band.  The IVC switches the IF input between
        the 70-m and 34-m HEF antennas.
 
        The RIV contains the tunable second LO, a set of video
        bandpass filters, IF attenuators, and a controller (RIC).
        The LO tuning is done via DSP control of the POCA/PLO
        combination based on a predict set.  The POCA is a
        Programmable Oscillator Control Assembly and the PLO is a
        Programmable Local Oscillator (commonly called the DANA
        synthesizer).  The bandpass filters are selectable via the
        DSP.  The RIC provides an interface between the DSP and the
        RIV.  It is controlled from the LMC via the DSP.  The RIC
        selects the filter and attenuator settings and provides
        monitor data to the DSP.  The RIC could also be manually
        controlled from the front panel in case the electronic
        interface to the DSP is lost.
 
        RF Monitor -- SSI and PPM: The RF monitor group of the
        Receiver-Exciter Subsystem provides spectral measurements
        using the Spectral Signal Indicator (SSI) and measurements of
        the received channel system temperature and spacecraft signal
        level using the Precision Power Monitor (PPM).
 
        The SSI provides a local display of the received signal
        spectrum at a dedicated terminal at the DSCC and routes these
        same data to the DSP which routes them to NOCC for remote
        display at JPL for real-time monitoring and RIV/DSP
        configuration verification.  These displays are used to
        validate Radio Science Subsystem data at the DSS, NOCC, and
        Mission Support Areas.  The SSI configuration is controlled
        by the DSP and a duplicate of the SSI spectrum appears on the
        LMC via the DSP.  During real-time operations the SSI data
        also serve as a quick-look science data type for Radio
        Science experiments.
 
        The PPM measures system noise temperatures (SNT) using a
        Noise Adding Radiometer (NAR) and downlink signal levels
        using the Signal Level Estimator (SLE).  The PPM accepts its
        input from the closed-loop receiver.  The SNT is measured by
        injecting known amounts of noise power into the signal path
        and comparing the total power with the noise injection &apos;on&apos;
        against the total power with the noise injection &apos;off.&apos; That
        operation is based on the fact that receiver noise power is
        directly proportional to temperature; thus measuring the
        relative increase in noise power due to the presence of a
        calibrated thermal noise source allows direct calculation of
        SNT.  Signal level is measured by calculating an FFT to
        estimate the SNR between the signal level and the receiver
        noise floor where the power is known from the SNT
        measurements.
 
        There is one PPM controller at the SPC which is used to
        control all SNT measurements.  The SNT integration time can
        be selected to represent the time required for a measurement
        of 30K to have a one-sigma uncertainty of 0.3K or 1%.
 
 
      DSCC Transmitter Subsystem
      --------------------------
        The Transmitter Subsystem accepts the S-band frequency
        exciter signal from the Block III or Block IV Receiver-
        Exciter Subsystem exciter and amplifies it to the required
        transmit output level.  The amplified signal is routed via
        the diplexer through the feed horn to the antenna and then
        focused and beamed to the spacecraft.
 
        The Transmitter Subsystem power capabilities range from 18 kw
        to 400 kw.  Power levels above 18 kw are available only at
        70-m stations.
 
 
      DSCC Tracking Subsystem
      -----------------------
        The Tracking Subsystem primary functions are to acquire and
        maintain communications with the spacecraft and to generate
        and format radiometric data containing Doppler and range.
 
        The DSCC Tracking Subsystem (DTK) receives the carrier
        signals and ranging spectra from the Receiver-Exciter
        Subsystem.  The Doppler cycle counts are counted, formatted,
        and transmitted to JPL in real time.  Ranging data are also
        transmitted to JPL in real time.  Also contained in these
        blocks is the AGC information from the Receiver-Exciter
        Subsystem.  The Radio Metric Data Conditioning Team (RMDCT)
        at JPL produces an Archival Tracking Data File (ATDF) which
        contains Doppler and ranging data.
 
        In addition, the Tracking Subsystem receives from the CMC
        frequency predicts (used to compute frequency residuals and
        noise estimates), receiver tuning predicts (used to tune the
        closed-loop receivers), and uplink tuning predicts (used to
        tune the exciter).  From the LMC, it receives configuration
        and control directives as well as configuration and status
        information on the transmitter, microwave, and frequency and
        timing subsystems.
 
        The Metric Data Assembly (MDA) controls all of the DTK
        functions supporting the uplink and downlink activities.  The
        MDA receives uplink predicts and controls the uplink tuning
        by commanding the DCO.  The MDA also controls the Sequential
        Ranging Assembly (SRA).  It formats the Doppler and range
        measurements and provides them to the GCF for transmission to
        NOCC.
 
        The Sequential Ranging Assembly (SRA) measures the round trip
        light time (RTLT) of a radio signal traveling from a ground
        tracking station to a spacecraft and back.  From the RTLT,
        phase, and Doppler data, the spacecraft range can be
        determined.  A coded signal is modulated on an uplink carrier
        and transmitted to the spacecraft where it is detected and
        transponded back to the ground station.  As a result, the
        signal received at the tracking station is delayed by its
        round trip through space and shifted in frequency by the
        Doppler effect due to the relative motion between the
        spacecraft and the tracking station on Earth.
 
 
      DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP)
      ----------------------------------------
        The DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP) located at the
        SPC digitizes and records the narrowband output data from
        the RIV.  It consists of a Narrow Band Occultation Converter
        (NBOC) containing four Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs),
        a ModComp CLASSIC computer processor called the Spectrum
        Processing Assembly (SPA), and several magnetic tape drives.
        Magnetic tapes containing DSP output are known as Original
        Data Records (ODRs).  Electronic near real-time data
        transmission (known as an Original Data Stream, or ODS) may
        be possible in certain circumstances.
 
        The DSP is operated through the LMC.  Using the
        SPA-Radioscience (SPA-R) software, the DSP allows for
        real-time frequency and time offsets (while in RUN mode)
        and, if necessary, snap tuning between the two frequency
        ranges transmitted by the spacecraft: coherent and
        non-coherent.  The DSP receives Radio Science frequency
        predicts from the CMC, allows for multiple predict set
        archiving (up to 60 sets) at the SPA, and allows for manual
        predict generation and editing.  It accepts configuration
        and control data from the LMC, provides display data to the
        LMC, and transmits the signal spectra from the SSI as well
        as status information to NOCC and the Project Mission
        Support Area (MSA) via the GCF data lines.  The DSP records
        the digitized narrowband samples and the supporting header
        information (i.e., time tags, POCA frequencies, etc.) on
        9-track magnetic tapes in 6250 or 1600 bpi GCR format.
 
        Through the DSP-RIC interface the DSP controls the RIV filter
        selection and attenuation levels.  It also receives RIV
        performance monitoring via the RIC.  In case of failure of
        the DSP-RIC interface, the RIV can be controlled manually
        from the front panel.
 
        All the RIV and DSP control parameters and configuration
        directives are stored in the SPA in a macro-like file called
        an &apos;experiment directive&apos; table.  A number of default
        directives exist in the DSP for the major Radio Science
        experiments.  Operators can create their own table entries.
 
        Items such as verification of the configuration of the prime
        open-loop recording subsystem, the selection of the required
        predict sets, and proper system performance prior to the
        recording periods will be checked in real-time at JPL via the
        NOCC displays using primarily the remote SSI display at NOCC
        and the NRV displays.  Because of this, transmission of the
        DSP/SSI monitor information is enabled prior to the start of
        recording.  The specific run time and tape recording times
        will be identified in the Sequence of Events (SOE) and/or DSN

        The DSP can be used to duplicate ODRs.  It also has the
        capability to play back a certain section of the recorded
        data after conclusion of the recording periods.
 
 
      DSCC Frequency and Timing Subsystem
      -----------------------------------
        The Frequency and Timing Subsystem (FTS) provides all
        frequency and timing references required by the other DSCC
        subsystems.  It contains four frequency standards of which
        one is prime and the other three are backups.  Selection of
        the prime standard is done via the CMC.  Of these four
        standards, two are hydrogen masers followed by clean-up loops
        (CUL) and two are cesium standards.  These four standards all
        feed the Coherent Reference Generator (CRG) which provides
        the frequency references used by the rest of the complex.  It
        also provides the frequency reference to the Master Clock
        Assembly (MCA) which in turn provides time to the Time
        Insertion and Distribution Assembly (TID) which provides UTC
        and SIM-time to the complex.
 
        JPL&apos;s ability to monitor the FTS at each DSCC is limited to
        the MDA calculated Doppler pseudo-residuals, the Doppler
        noise, the SSI, and to a system which uses the Global
        Positioning System (GPS).  GPS receivers at each DSCC receive
        a one-pulse-per-second pulse from the station&apos;s (hydrogen
        maser referenced) FTS and a pulse from a GPS satellite at
        scheduled times.  After compensating for the satellite signal
        delay, the timing offset is reported to JPL where a database
        is kept.  The clock offsets stored in the JPL database are
        given in microseconds; each entry is a mean reading of
        measurements from several GPS satellites and a time tag
        associated with the mean reading.  The clock offsets provided
        include those of SPC 10 relative to UTC (NIST), SPC 40
        relative to SPC 10, etc.
 
 
    Optics - DSN
    ============
      Performance of DSN ground stations depends primarily on size of
      the antenna and capabilities of electronics.  These are
      summarized in the following set of tables.  Note that 64-m
      antennas were upgraded to 70-m between 1986 and 1989.
      Beamwidth is half-power full angular width.  Polarization is
      circular; L denotes left circular polarization (LCP), and R
      denotes right circular polarization (RCP).

           NB: X-band 64-m and 70-m transmitting parameters are given
               at 8495 MHz, the frequency used by the Goldstone
               planetary radar system.  For telecommunications, the
               transmitting frequency would be in the range 7145-7190
               MHz, the power would typically be 20 kW, and the gain
               would be about 72.6 dB (70-m antenna).  When ground
               transmitters are used in spacecraft radio science
               experiments, the details of transmitter and antenna
               performance rarely impact the results.

      DSCC Open-Loop Receiver (RIV)
      -----------------------------
        The open loop receiver block diagram shown below is for the
        RIV system at 70-m and 34-m High-Efficiency (HEF) antenna
        sites.  Input signals at both S- and X-band are mixed to
        approximately 300 MHz by fixed-frequency local oscillators
        near the antenna feed.  Based on a tuning prediction file,
        the POCA controls the DANA synthesizer, the output of which
        (after multiplication) mixes the 300 MHz IF to 50 MHz for
        amplification.  These signals in turn are down converted and
        passed through additional filters until they yield Output
        with bandwidths up to 45 kHz.  The Output is digitally
        sampled and either written to magnetic tape or electronically
        transferred for further analysis.

        Reconstruction of the antenna frequency from the frequency of
        the signal in the recorded data can be achieved through use
        of one of the following formulas.  Filters are defined below.
 
   FSant=3*SYN+1.95*10^9+3*(790/11)*10^6+Frec        (Filter 4)
        =3*SYN+1.95*10^9+3*(790/11)*10^6-Fsamp+Frec  (Filters 1-3,5,6)
 
   FXant=11*SYN + 7.940*10^9 +   Fsamp - Frec        (Filter 4)
        =11*SYN + 7.940*10^9 - 3*Fsamp + Frec        (Filters 1,2,3,6)
 
    where
        FSant,FXant  are the antenna frequencies of the incoming
                      signals at S and X bands, respectively,
        SYN          is the output frequency of the DANA synthesizer,
                      commonly labeled the readback POCA frequency on
                      data tapes,
        Fsamp        is the effective sampling rate of the digital
                      samples, and
        Frec         is the apparent signal frequency in a spectrum
                      reconstructed from the digital samples.
 
           NB: For many of the filter choices (see below) the Output
               is that of a bandpass filter.  The sampling rates
               in the table below are sufficient for the bandwidth
               but not the absolute maximum frequency, and aliasing
               results.  The reconstruction expressions above are
               appropriate ONLY when the sample rate shown in the
               tables below is used.

        which (after multiplication) mixes input signals at both

        amplification.  These signals in turn are down converted
        and passed through additional filters until they yield Output
        with bandwidths up to 45 kHz.  The Output is digitally

      DSCC Open-Loop Receiver (MMR at DSS 7 and 42)
      ---------------------------------------------
        The open loop receiver block diagram shown below is for the
        MMR system at the 34-m Standard (STD) DSS 42 antenna site and
        the DSS 7 DSN facility at JPL.  Based on a tuning prediction
        file, the POCA controls the DANA synthesizer, the output of
        which (after multiplication) mixes input signals at both
        S- and X-band to fixed intermediate frequencies for
        amplification.  These signals in turn are down converted and
        passed through additional filters until they yield Output
        with bandwidths up to 45 kHz.  The Output is digitally
        sampled and either written to magnetic tape or electronically
        transferred for further analysis.

    Detectors - DSN
    ===============
 
      DSCC Open-Loop Receivers
      ------------------------
        Open-loop receiver output is detected in software by the
        radio science investigator.

        Nominal carrier tracking loop threshold noise bandwidth at
        both S- and X-band is 10 Hz.  Coherent (two-way) closed-loop
        system stability is shown in the table below:

    Calibration - DSN
    =================
      Calibrations of hardware systems are carried out periodically
      by DSN personnel; these ensure that systems operate at required
      performance levels -- for example, that antenna patterns,
      receiver gain, propagation delays, and Doppler uncertainties
      meet specifications.  No information on specific calibration
      activities is available.  Nominal performance specifications
      are shown in the tables above.  Additional information may be
      available in [DSN810-5].
 
      Prior to each tracking pass, station operators perform a series
      of calibrations to ensure that systems meet specifications for
      that operational period.  Included in these calibrations is
      measurement of receiver system temperature in the configuration
      to be employed during the pass.  Results of these calibrations
      are recorded in (hard copy) Controller&apos;s Logs for each pass.
 
      The nominal procedure for initializing open-loop receiver
      attenuator settings is described below.  In cases where widely
      varying signal levels are expected, the procedure may be
      modified in advance or real-time adjustments may be made to
      attenuator settings.
 
 
      Open-Loop Receiver Attenuation Calibration
      ------------------------------------------
        The open-loop receiver attenuator calibrations are performed
        to establish the output of the open-loop receivers at a level
        that will not saturate the analog-to-digital converters.  To
        achieve this, the calibration is done using a test signal
        generated by the exciter/translator that is set to the peak
        predicted signal level for the upcoming pass.  Then the
        output level of the receiver&apos;s video band spectrum envelope
        is adjusted to the level determined by equation (3) below (to
        five-sigma).  Note that the SNR in the equation (2) is in dB
        while the SNR in equation (3) is linear.

    Operational Considerations - DSN
    ================================
      The DSN is a complex and dynamic &apos;instrument.&apos; Its performance
      for Radio Science depends on a number of factors from equipment
      configuration to meteorological conditions.  No specific
      information on &apos;operational considerations&apos; can be given here.
 
 
    Operational Modes - DSN
    =======================
 
      DSCC Antenna Mechanical Subsystem
      ---------------------------------
        Pointing of DSCC antennas may be carried out in several ways.
        For details see the subsection &apos;DSCC Antenna Mechanical
        Subsystem&apos; in the &apos;Subsystem&apos; section.  Binary pointing is
        the preferred mode for tracking spacecraft; pointing
        predicts are provided, and the antenna simply follows those.
        With CONSCAN, the antenna scans conically about the optimum
        pointing direction, using closed-loop receiver signal
        strength estimates as feedback.  In planetary mode, the
        system interpolates from three (slowly changing) RA-DEC
        target coordinates; this is &apos;blind&apos; pointing since there is
        no feedback from a detected signal.  In sidereal mode, the
        antenna tracks a fixed point on the celestial sphere.  In
        &apos;precision&apos; mode, the antenna pointing is adjusted using an
        optical feedback system.  It is possible on most antennas to
        freeze z-axis motion of the subreflector to minimize phase
        changes in the received signal.
 
 
      DSCC Receiver-Exciter Subsystem
      -------------------------------
        The diplexer in the signal path between the transmitter and
        the feed horns on all three antennas may be configured so
        that it is out of the received signal path in order to
        improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the receiver system.
        This is known as the &apos;listen-only&apos; or &apos;bypass&apos; mode.
 
 
      Closed-Loop vs. Open-Loop Reception
      -----------------------------------
        Radio Science data can be collected in two modes: closed-
        loop, in which a phase-locked loop receiver tracks the
        spacecraft signal, or open-loop, in which a receiver samples
        and records a band within which the desired signal presumably
        resides.  Closed-loop data are collected using Closed-Loop
        Receivers, and open-loop data are collected using Open-Loop
        Receivers in conjunction with the DSCC Spectrum Processing
        Subsystem (DSP).  See the Subsystems section for further
        information.
 
 
      Closed-Loop Receiver AGC Loop
      -----------------------------
        The closed-loop receiver AGC loop can be configured to one of
        three settings: narrow, medium, or wide.  Ordinarily it is
        configured so that expected signal amplitude changes are
        accommodated with minimum distortion.  The loop bandwidth is
        ordinarily configured so that expected phase changes can be
        accommodated while maintaining the best possible loop SNR.
 
 
      Coherent vs. Non-Coherent Operation
      -----------------------------------
        The frequency of the signal transmitted from the spacecraft
        can generally be controlled in two ways -- by locking to a
        signal received from a ground station or by locking to an
        on-board oscillator.  These are known as the coherent (or
        &apos;two-way&apos;) and non-coherent (&apos;one-way&apos;) modes, respectively.
        Mode selection is made at the spacecraft, based on commands
        received from the ground.  When operating in the coherent
        mode, the transponder carrier frequency is derived from the
        received uplink carrier frequency with a &apos;turn-around ratio&apos;
        typically of 240/221.  In the non-coherent mode, the
        downlink carrier frequency is derived from the spacecraft
        on-board crystal-controlled oscillator.  Either closed-loop
        or open-loop receivers (or both) can be used with either
        spacecraft frequency reference mode.  Closed-loop reception
        in two-way mode is usually preferred for routine tracking.
        Occasionally the spacecraft operates coherently while two
        ground stations receive the &apos;downlink&apos; signal; this is
        sometimes known as the &apos;three-way&apos; mode.
 
 
      DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP)
      ----------------------------------------
        The DSP can operate in four sampling modes with from 1 to 4
        input signals.  Input channels are assigned to ADC inputs
        during DSP configuration.  Modes and sampling rates are
        summarized in the tables below:

    Measurement Parameters - DSN
    ============================
 
      Open-Loop System
      ----------------
        Output from the Open-Loop Receivers (OLRs), as sampled and
        recorded by the DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP), is
        a stream of 8- or 12-bit quantized voltage samples.  The
        nominal input to the Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) is
        +/-10 volts, but the precise scaling between input voltages
        and output digitized samples is usually irrelevant for
        analysis; the digital data are generally referenced to a
        known noise or signal level within the data stream itself --
        for example, the thermal noise output of the radio receivers
        which has a known system noise temperature (SNT).  Raw
        samples comprise the data block in each DSP record; a header
        record (presently 83 16-bit words) contains ancillary
        information such as:
 
         time tag for the first sample in the data block
         RMS values of receiver signal levels and ADC outputs
         POCA frequency and drift rate
 
 
      Closed-Loop System
      ------------------
        Closed-loop data are recorded in Archival Tracking Data Files
        (ATDFs), as well as certain secondary products such as the
        Orbit Data File (ODF).  The ATDF Tracking Logical Record
        contains 117 entries including status information and
        measurements of ranging, Doppler, and signal strength.

    Instrument Overview
    ===================
      The Voyager 2 Radio Science investigations at Neptune utilized
      instrumentation with elements both on the spacecraft and at
      the DSN.  Much of this was shared equipment, being used for
      routine telecommunications as well as for Radio Science.
      The performance and calibration of both the spacecraft and
      tracking stations directly affected the radio science data
      accuracy, and they played a major role in determining the
      quality of the results.  The spacecraft part of the radio
      science instrument is described immediately below; that is
      followed by a description of the DSN (ground) part of the
      instrument.
 
 
    Instrument Specifications - Spacecraft
    ======================================
      The Voyager 2 spacecraft telecommunications subsystem served
      as part of a radio science subsystem for investigations of
      Neptune.  Many details of the subsystem are unknown; its
      &apos;build date&apos; is taken to be 1977-08-20, which was the launch
      date for Voyager 2.

    Instrument Overview - Spacecraft
    ================================
      The spacecraft radio system was constructed around a redundant
      pair of transponders.  Each transponder was equipped with an
      S-band receiver (2115 MHz nominal frequency) and transmitters
      at both S-band (2295 MHz nominal) and X-band (8415 MHz nominal).
      Compared with S-band, X-band is less sensitive to plasma effects
      by a factor of about 10; use of both frequencies coherently on
      the &apos;downlink&apos; allowed estimation of plasma content along the
      radio path.  Use of X-band also significantly improved the
      quality of radio tracking data for gravity investigations.
 
      The transponder generated downlink signals in either &apos;coherent&apos;
      or &apos;non-coherent&apos; modes, also known as &apos;two-way&apos; and &apos;one-way,&apos;
      respectively.  When operating in the coherent mode, the
      transmitted carrier frequency was derived coherently from the
      received uplink carrier frequency with a &apos;turn-around ratio&apos; of
      240/221 at S-band and (11/3)*240/221 at X-band.
 
      In non-coherent mode the transmitted frequency was controlled
      by an on-board oscillator; the X- and S-band remained coherent
      in the ratio 11/3.  A single Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) was
      used during radio occultations; it provided stabilities
      several orders of magnitude better than the conventional
      crystal oscillators, which were part of each transponder.
 
      Stability of the Voyager 2 USO was specified in terms of its
      Allan Deviation -- the fractional frequency deviation from
      linear drift [ALLAN1966].  Over 10 minute periods, the Allan
      Deviation ranged from 10^-12 to 4 10^-12 for integrations of
      1-10 sec.  Long-term fractional drift of the oscillator was
      about 5 10^-11 per day.  Although the oscillator was hardened,
      there were discontinuities in the drift when the spacecraft
      passed through the radiation belts of the outer planets.  The
      equivalent microwave frequency of the USO at Voyager 2
      Jupiter occultation ingress was:
 
                     2,296,481,070.940 Hz (S-band)
                     8,420,430,593.447 Hz (X-band)
 
      Traveling wave tube or solid state amplifiers boosted the
      transponder output.  Output powers of 9 and 26  watts could
      be selected at S-band; the choices at X-band were 12 and 22
      watts.
 
      The signals were radiated via a 3.66 m diameter parabolic high
      gain antenna (HGA).  The HGA transmit boresight gain of
      the HGA was 36 dB at S-band and 47 dB at X-band.  The half-power
      half-width of the antenna beam was 0.32 degrees at X-band and
      1.1 degrees at S-band.  Transmit polarization was right-hand
      circular at S-band and either right- or left-hand circular at
      X-band.  A Low-Gain Antenna (LGA) was mounted on the feed
      structure of the HGA and radiated approximately uniformly over
      the hemisphere into which the HGA pointed.  It was used during
      maneuvers, spacecraft anomalies, and at other times when the
      HGA was not appropriate.
 
      For receiving, the S-band HGA gain was 35 dB at 2115 MHz and the
      polarization was right-hand circular.  The receiving system
      noise temperature was approximately 2000K, the carrier tracking
      loop bandwidth was 18 Hz, and the ranging channel noise
      bandwidth was 1.5 MHz.
 
      More information can be found in [ESHLEMANETAL1977].
 
 
    Science Objectives
    ==================
      Science objectives fell into two broad areas of investigation --
      those that could be met using high-precision radiometric data
      (sometimes known as &apos;tracking&apos; data) and those that could be met
      from studying characteristics of the radio signal after its
      interaction with an atmosphere, plasma, ring particles, or other
      intervening medium.  The tracking data were fundamental to
      inferring the gravitational forces on the spacecraft and
      relativistic effects along the radio path; both the measured
      time delay during a two-way transmission and the Doppler shift
      were used.  Investigators seeking knowledge of atmospheric
      structure, spatial and size distributions of ring particles,
      and velocity of the solar wind measured amplitude, frequency
      (and phase), and polarization of the radio signals which were
      captured by Earth receiving systems.  There are, of course,
      investigations which use both types of data.
 
 
      Gravity Measurements
      --------------------
        The frequency of the downlink carrier signal was precisely
        measured to determine the magnitude of the Doppler shift
        caused by acceleration of the spacecraft as it passed near
        either a single body or a system of bodies.  Since the
        magnitude of the Doppler shift is related to the gravitational
        field strength, the mass of the body (or bodies) can be
        determined.  If the radius of the body is known (as from
        calibrated images), the density can be calculated.
 
        Doppler and range tracking measurements yield accurate
        spacecraft trajectory solutions.  Simultaneously with
        reconstruction of the spacecraft orbit, observation equations
        for the central mass, low order coefficients for the field,
        and a small number of ancillary parameters can be solved.
        Measurements of the gravity field provide significant
        constraints on inferences about the interior structure of
        target bodies.
 
        The Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft came closer to Jupiter than
        Voyager, so there was no net improvement in the Jupiter mass
        estimate from Voyager.  But Voyager probed the Galilean
        satellites at closer range, and better mass estimates were
        obtained.  The Voyager encounters with Saturn, in conjunction
        with the close flyby of Pioneer 11, yielded a mass estimate
        comparable to that of Jupiter along with several low-order
        zonal harmonic coefficients.  Voyager 2 was targeted for a
        close encounter with Miranda, an inner satellite of Uranus;
        that, combined with long tracking arcs through the Uranian
        system, yielded the first good estimates of masses for the
        five largest satellites and an improved mass estimate for
        Uranus itself.  The Voyager 2 very close near-polar flyby
        with Neptune yielded estimates for the zonal harmonic
        coefficients J2 and J4 in addition to estimates for the mass
        of both Neptune and Triton.
 
 
      Atmospheric and Ionospheric Radio Occultation Measurements
      ----------------------------------------------------------
        Atmospheric measurements by the method of radio occultation
        contribute to an improved understanding of structure,
        circulation, dynamics, and transport in atmospheres of remote
        planetary bodies.  These results are based on detailed
        analysis of the radio signal received from the spacecraft as
        it enters and exits occultation by the planet.  Three phases
        of an atmospheric investigation may be defined.  The first is
        to obtain vertical profiles of atmospheric structure
        (temperature and pressure in the neutral atmosphere and
        electron density in the ionosphere) with emphasis on large-
        scale phenomena.  During this stage, it is necessary to know
        the mean molecular weight of the atmosphere; for Voyager
        the hydrogen-helium mixing ratio could be determined for each
        planet using the radio data in conjunction with Voyager IRIS
        data.  Second is to investigate absorption at various levels
        in the atmosphere -- such as by methane.  Third is to
        study details of the structure, such as result from
        propagation of buoyancy waves within a neutral atmosphere or
        from alignment of charged particles along magnetic field lines
        in an ionosphere.
 
        Retrieval of atmospheric profiles requires coherent
        samples of the radio signal that has propagated through
        the atmosphere, plus accurate knowledge of the antenna
        pointing and the spacecraft trajectory.  The spatial and
        temporal coverage in radio occultation experiments are
        determined by the observing geometry, including the spacecraft
        trajectory.  For deep atmospheres, changes in antenna pointing
        may be required to compensate for refractive bending by the
        atmosphere.  At Jupiter and Saturn both diametric and grazing
        occultations were obtained using the two Voyager spacecraft;
        measurements were obtained at both equatorial and polar
        latitudes.  Voyager 1 also obtained profiles for Titan.
        Voyager 2 continued to Uranus and Neptune, and also obtained
        occultation profiles at Triton.
 
 
      Radio Measurements on Planetary Rings
      -------------------------------------
        Radio occultation measurements of planetary rings are carried
        out using procedures similar to those employed for atmospheric
        occultations.  Although absorption by ring particles must be
        considered, the dominant effect on strength of the directly
        propagating signal is believed to be conservative scattering.
        Profiles of received signal strength can be inverted to yield
        the radial distribution of ring material.  Doppler spreading
        of the signal scattered in the near-forward direction can be
        used to infer the particle size distribution, especially when
        measurements at the two Voyager radio wavelengths are
        combined.
 
        Ring occultations were planned and observed at Saturn and
        Uranus.  Measurements were carried out at Neptune, but no
        rings or arcs were detected using the radio system.  A post-
        encounter search for a radio ring occultation at Jupiter was
        unsuccessful.
 
        Voyager 2 also carried out an oblique forward scattering
        experiment during its Saturn encounter.  The spacecraft high-
        gain antenna was deflected from the Earth direction so that
        it illuminated the ring system; but no scattered signal was
        detected.
 
 
      Solar Conjunction Experiments
      -----------------------------
        Solar conjunction experiments were conducted to improve
        understanding of the structure and dynamics of the solar
        corona and wind, to improve understanding of relativistic
        effects when radio waves propagate near the Sun, and to test
        the different elements of the radio science subsystem.
        Approximately once per year, each Voyager spacecraft appeared
        to pass behind the solar disk, as seen from Earth.  Radio
        waves propagating between Voyager and Earth stations were
        refracted and scattered (scintillation) by the solar plasma
        [WOO1993].  Intensity fluctuations can be related to
        fluctuations in electron density along the path, while Doppler
        or phase scintillations can be related to both electron
        density fluctuations and also the speed of the solar wind.
        Many plasma effects decrease as the square of the radio
        frequency; plasma effects are about an order of magnitude
        stronger at S-band than X-band.
 
 
      Experimental Relativity
      -----------------------
        The gravitational field of the Sun causes a time delay on
        signals that propagate near the Sun of approximately 300
        microseconds.  Although previous tests had verified the effect
        to an accuracy of a few percent, Voyager measurements could
        be conducted annually and at two frequencies, allowing
        separation of plasma effects.
 
        Gravitational fields of the gas giant planets also affected
        radio signals by causing them to have apparent frequencies
        lower than predicted.  The change in frequency is related to
        the mass of the planet.  By measuring the change in frequency
        as the spacecraft approached the planet, a value for the mass
        could be calculated.  This value could then be compared with
        the mass derived from two-way tracking data.  The spacecraft
        Ultra-Stable Oscillator was used for these measurements;
        two-way transmissions have nearly canceling frequency shifts
        as the signal travels to the spacecraft and then returns.  The
        dual frequencies available from Voyager allowed correction for
        plasma effects along the radio path, but calibration for
        radiation damage to the USO during encounters was more
        difficult.
 
 
    Operational Considerations - Spacecraft
    =======================================
      Descriptions given here are for nominal performance.  The
      spacecraft transponder system comprised redundant units,
      each with slightly different characteristics.  As
      transponder units age, their performance changes slightly.
      More importantly, the performance for radio science depended
      on operational factors such as the modulation state for the
      transmitters, which cannot be predicted in advance.  The
      performance also depended on factors which were not always
      under the control of the Voyager Project.
 
      Spacecraft receivers were designed to lock to the uplink
      signal.  Without locking, Doppler effects -- resulting from
      relative motion of the spacecraft and ground station -- could
      result in loss of the radio link as the frequency of the
      received signal drifted.  Unfortunately, a series of failures
      in the Voyager 2 receivers left that transponder unable to
      track the uplink signal.  Beginning in April 1978, Doppler
      shifts were predicted and the uplink carrier was tuned so
      that Voyager 2 would see what appeared to be a signal at
      constant frequency (to an accuracy of 100 Hz).
 
      During deep occultations by the giant planets, the bending angle
      resulting from refraction exceeded 10 degrees in some cases --
      well beyond the half power beamwidth of the spacecraft antenna.
      In those cases, the pointing of the HGA was adjusted so that
      it followed a &apos;virtual&apos; Earth and maximum signal strength could
      be sustained.  These &apos;limb-track&apos; maneuvers were critically
      dependent on accurate timing in the encounter.  To protect
      against timing errors at Titan (primarily from uncertaintes in
      the radius and position of the satellite), no limb-track was
      attempted during ingress while a fixed antenna offset was used
      during egress.
 
      Although the spacecraft radioisotope thermoelectric generators
      were not dependent on solar flux for power, their output decayed
      as the Voyager spacecraft moved outward through the solar
      system.  During encounters with the outer planets, caution was
      required in budgeting power and the high-power mode could not
      be used for the radio transmitters.
 
 
    Calibration Description - Spacecraft
    ====================================
      Prior to and during some encounter sequences, the spacecraft
      was commanded to execute a &apos;mini-azcal&apos; maneuver.  The HGA was
      moved slightly above the Earth line then slightly below the
      Earth line.  The procedure was repeated to the left and right
      of the Earth line so that a &apos;cross-hair&apos; pattern was mapped
      out.  During the maneuver, the amplitude of the carrier
      signal was measured carefully.  Analysis of the results would
      show whether the HGA was pointed accurately and, if not,
      approximately the error and direction.
 
      Prior to and after encounters, the spacecraft frequency
      reference was switched to the USO for several hours and the
      carrier signal was monitored using equipment at the DSN.
      These &apos;USO Tests&apos; were used to calibrate the frequency and
      frequency drift of the USO.  USO tests were particularly
      important before and after the spacecraft entered a severe
      radiation environment since the radiation typically damaged
      the crystal and changed its characteristics slightly.
 
 
    Platform Mounting Descriptions - Spacecraft
    ===========================================
      The centerline of the bus was the roll axis of the
      spacecraft; it also served as the z-axis of the spacecraft
      coordinate system with the high-gain antenna (HGA) boresight
      defining the negative z-direction.  The HGA boresight was
      also defined as cone angle 0 degrees and as azimuth 180
      degrees, elevation 7 degrees.  The Low-Gain Antenna (LGA)
      was mounted on the feed structure of the HGA and radiated
      approximately uniformly over the hemisphere into which the
      HGA pointed.
 
 
    Principal Investigators
    =======================
      The Radio Science Team Leader through the Jupiter encounters
      was Von R. Eshleman.  The Team Leader for the Saturn, Uranus,
      and Neptune encounters was G. Leonard Tyler.

    Instrument Overview - DSN
    =========================
      Three Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs) (near
      Barstow, CA; Canberra, Australia; and Madrid, Spain) comprise
      the DSN tracking network.  Each complex is equipped with
      several antennas [including at least one each 70-m, 34-m High
      Efficiency (HEF), and 34-m standard (STD)], associated
      electronics, and operational systems.  Primary activity at each
      complex is radiation of commands to and reception of telemetry
      data from active spacecraft.  Transmission and reception is
      possible in several radio-frequency bands, the most common
      being S-band (nominally a frequency of 2100-2300 MHz or a
      wavelength of 14.2-13.0 cm) and X-band (7100-8500 MHz or 4.2-
      3.5 cm).  Transmitter output powers of up to 400 kw are
      available.
 
      Ground stations have the ability to transmit coded and uncoded
      waveforms which can be echoed by distant spacecraft.  Analysis
      of the received coding allows navigators to determine the
      distance to the spacecraft; analysis of Doppler shift on the
      carrier signal allows estimation of the line-of-sight
      spacecraft velocity.  Range and Doppler measurements are used
      to calculate the spacecraft trajectory and to infer gravity
      fields of objects near the spacecraft.
 
      Ground stations can record spacecraft signals that have
      propagated through or been scattered from target media.
      Measurements of signal parameters after wave interactions with
      surfaces, atmospheres, rings, and plasmas are used to infer
      physical and electrical properties of the target.
 
      Principal investigators vary from experiment to experiment.
      See the corresponding section of the spacecraft instrument
      description or the data set description for specifics.

    Subsystems - DSN
    ================
      The Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs) are an integral
      part of the Radio Science instrument, along with other
      receiving stations and the spacecraft Radio Frequency
      Subsystem.  Their system performance directly determines the
      degree of success of Radio Science investigations, and their
      system calibration determines the degree of accuracy in the
      results of the experiments.  The following paragraphs describe
      the functions performed by the individual subsystems of a DSCC.
      This material has been adapted from [ASMAR&amp;HERRERA1993]; for
      additional information, consult [DSN810-5].
 
      Each DSCC includes a set of antennas, a Signal Processing
      Center (SPC), and communication links to the Jet Propulsion
      Laboratory (JPL).  The general configuration is illustrated
      below; antennas (Deep Space Stations, or DSS -- a term carried
      over from earlier times when antennas were individually
      instrumented) are listed in the table.

      DSCC Monitor and Control Subsystem
      ----------------------------------
        The DSCC Monitor and Control Subsystem (DMC) is part of the
        Monitor and Control System (MON) which also includes the
        ground communications Central Communications Terminal and the
        Network Operations Control Center (NOCC) Monitor and Control
        Subsystem.  The DMC is the center of activity at a DSCC.  The
        DMC receives and archives most of the information from the
        NOCC needed by the various DSCC subsystems during their
        operation.  Control of most of the DSCC subsystems, as well
        as the handling and displaying of any responses to control
        directives and configuration and status information received
        from each of the subsystems, is done through the DMC.  The
        effect of this is to centralize the control, display, and
        archiving functions necessary to operate a DSCC.
        Communication among the various subsystems is done using a
        Local Area Network (LAN) hooked up to each subsystem via a
        network interface unit (NIU).
 
        DMC operations are divided into two separate areas: the
        Complex Monitor and Control (CMC) and the Link Monitor and
        Control (LMC).  The primary purpose of the CMC processor for
        Radio Science support is to receive and store all predict
        sets transmitted from NOCC such as Radio Science, antenna
        pointing, tracking, receiver, and uplink predict sets and
        then, at a later time, to distribute them to the appropriate
        subsystems via the LAN.  Those predict sets can be stored in
        the CMC for a maximum of three days under normal conditions.
        The CMC also receives, processes, and displays event/alarm
        messages; maintains an operator log; and produces tape labels
        for the DSP.  Assignment and configuration of the LMCs is
        done through the CMC; to a limited degree the CMC can perform
        some of the functions performed by the LMC.  There are two
        CMCs (one on-line and one backup) and three LMCs at each DSCC
        The backup CMC can function as an additional LMC if
        necessary.
 
        The LMC processor provides the operator interface for monitor
        and control of a link -- a group of equipment required to
        support a spacecraft pass.  For Radio Science, a link might
        include the DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP) (which,
        in turn, can control the SSI), or the Tracking Subsystem.
        The LMC also maintains an operator log which includes
        operator directives and subsystem responses.  One important
        Radio Science specific function that the LMC performs is
        receipt and transmission of the system temperature and signal
        level data from the PPM for display at the LMC console and
        for inclusion in Monitor blocks.  These blocks are recorded
        on magnetic tape as well as appearing in the Mission Control
        and Computing Center (MCCC) displays.  The LMC is required to
        operate without interruption for the duration of the Radio
        Science data acquisition period.
 
        The Area Routing Assembly (ARA), which is part of the Digital
        Communications Subsystem, controls all data communication
        between the stations and JPL.  The ARA receives all required
        data and status messages from the LMC/CMC and can record them
        to tape as well as transmit them to JPL via data lines.  The
        ARA also receives predicts and other data from JPL and passes
        them on to the CMC.
 
 
      DSCC Antenna Mechanical Subsystem
      ---------------------------------
        Multi-mission Radio Science activities require support from
        the 70-m, 34-m HEF, and 34-m STD antenna subnets.  The
        antennas at each DSCC function as large-aperture collectors
        which, by double reflection, cause the incoming radio
        frequency (RF) energy to enter the feed horns.  The large
        collecting surface of the antenna focuses the incoming energy
        onto a subreflector, which is adjustable in both axial and
        angular position.  These adjustments are made to correct for
        gravitational deformation of the antenna as it moves between
        zenith and the horizon; the deformation can be as large as
        5 cm.  The subreflector adjustments optimize the channeling
        of energy from the primary reflector to the subreflector
        and then to the feed horns.  The 70-m and 34-m HEF antennas
        have &apos;shaped&apos; primary and secondary reflectors, with forms
        that are modified paraboloids.  This customization allows
        more uniform illumination of one reflector by another.  The
        34-m STD primary reflectors are classical paraboloids, while
        the subreflectors are standard hyperboloids.
 
        On the 70-m and 34-m STD antennas, the subreflector directs
        received energy from the antenna onto a dichroic plate, a
        device which reflects S-band energy to the S-band feed horn
        and passes X-band energy through to the X-band feed horn.  In
        the 34-m HEF, there is one &apos;common aperture feed,&apos; which
        accepts both frequencies without requiring a dichroic plate.
        RF energy to be transmitted into space by the horns is
        focused by the reflectors into narrow cylindrical beams,
        pointed with high precision (either to the dichroic plate or
        directly to the subreflector) by a series of drive motors and
        gear trains that can rotate the movable components and their
        support structures.
 
        The different antennas can be pointed by several means.  Two
        pointing modes commonly used during tracking passes are
        CONSCAN and &apos;blind pointing.&apos; With CONSCAN enabled and a
        closed loop receiver locked to a spacecraft signal, the
        system tracks the radio source by conically scanning around
        its position in the sky.  Pointing angle adjustments are
        computed from signal strength information (feedback) supplied
        by the receiver.  In this mode the Antenna Pointing Assembly
        (APA) generates a circular scan pattern which is sent to the
        Antenna Control System (ACS).  The ACS adds the scan pattern
        to the corrected pointing angle predicts.  Software in the
        receiver-exciter controller computes the received signal
        level and sends it to the APA.  The correlation of scan
        position with the received signal level variations allows the
        APA to compute offset changes which are sent to the ACS.
        Thus, within the capability of the closed-loop control
        system, the scan center is pointed precisely at the apparent
        direction of the spacecraft signal source.  An additional
        function of the APA is to provide antenna position angles and
        residuals, antenna control mode/status information, and
        predict-correction parameters to the Area Routing Assembly
        (ARA) via the LAN, which then sends this information to JPL
        via the Ground Communications Facility (GCF) for antenna
        status monitoring.
 
        During periods when excessive signal level dynamics or low
        received signal levels are expected (e.g., during an
        occultation experiment), CONSCAN should not be used.  Under
        these conditions, blind pointing (CONSCAN OFF) is used, and
        pointing angle adjustments are based on a predetermined
        Systematic Error Correction (SEC) model.
 
        Independent of CONSCAN state, subreflector motion in at least
        the z-axis may introduce phase variations into the received
        Radio Science data.  For that reason, during certain
        experiments, the subreflector in the 70-m and 34-m HEFs may
        be frozen in the z-axis at a position (often based on
        elevation angle) selected to minimize phase change and signal
        degradation.  This can be done via Operator Control Inputs
        (OCIs) from the LMC to the Subreflector Controller (SRC)
        which resides in the alidade room of the antennas.  The SRC
        passes the commands to motors that drive the subreflector to
        the desired position.  Unlike the 70-m and 34-m HEFs which
        have azimuth-elevation (AZ-EL) drives, the 34-m STD antennas
        use (hour angle-declination) HA-DEC drives.  The same
        positioning of the subreflector on the 34-m STD does not
        create the same effect as on the 70-m and 34-m HEFs.
 
        Pointing angles for all three antenna types are computed by
        the NOCC Support System (NSS) from an ephemeris provided by
        the flight project.  These predicts are received and archived
        by the CMC.  Before each track, they are transferred to the
        APA, which transforms the direction cosines of the predicts
        into AZ-EL coordinates for the 70-m and 34-m HEFs or into
        HA-DEC coordinates for the 34-m STD antennas.  The LMC
        operator then downloads the antenna AZ-EL or HA-DEC predict
        points to the antenna-mounted ACS computer along with a
        selected SEC model.  The pointing predicts consist of
        time-tagged AZ-EL or HA-DEC points at selected time intervals
        along with polynomial coefficients for interpolation between
        points.
 
        The ACS automatically interpolates the predict points,
        corrects the pointing predicts for refraction and
        subreflector position, and adds the proper systematic error
        correction and any manually entered antenna offsets.  The ACS
        then sends angular position commands for each axis at the
        rate of one per second.  In the 70-m and 34-m HEF, rate
        commands are generated from the position commands at the
        servo controller and are subsequently used to steer the
        antenna.  In the 34-m STD antennas motors, rather than
        servos, are used to steer the antenna; there is no feedback
        once the 34-m STD has been told where to point.
 
        When not using binary predicts (the routine mode for
        spacecraft tracking), the antennas can be pointed using
        &apos;planetary mode&apos; -- a simpler mode which uses right ascension
        (RA) and declination (DEC) values.  These change very slowly
        with respect to the celestial frame.  Values are provided to
        the station in text form for manual entry.  The ACS
        quadratically interpolates among three RA and DEC points
        which are on one-day centers.
 
        A third pointing mode -- sidereal -- is available for
        tracking radio sources fixed with respect to the celestial
        frame.
 
        Regardless of the pointing mode being used, a 70-m antenna
        has a special high-accuracy pointing capability called
        &apos;precision&apos; mode.  A pointing control loop derives the
        main AZ-EL pointing servo drive error signals from a two-
        axis autocollimator mounted on the Intermediate Reference
        Structure.  The autocollimator projects a light beam to a
        precision mirror mounted on the Master Equatorial drive
        system, a much smaller structure, independent of the main
        antenna, which is exactly positioned in HA and DEC with shaft
        encoders.  The autocollimator detects elevation/cross-
        elevation errors between the two reference surfaces by
        measuring the angular displacement of the reflected light
        beam.  This error is compensated for in the antenna servo by
        moving the antenna in the appropriate AZ-EL direction.
        Pointing accuracies of 0.004 degrees (15 arc seconds) are
        possible in &apos;precision&apos; mode.  The &apos;precision&apos; mode is not
        available on 34-m antennas -- nor is it needed, since their
        beamwidths are twice as large as on the 70-m antennas.
 
 
      DSCC Antenna Microwave Subsystem
      --------------------------------
        70-m Antennas: Each 70-m antenna has three feed cones
        installed in a structure at the center of the main reflector.
        The feeds are positioned 120 degrees apart on a circle.
        Selection of the feed is made by rotation of the
        subreflector.  A dichroic mirror assembly, half on the S-band
        cone and half on the X-band cone, permits simultaneous use of
        the S- and X-band frequencies.  The third cone is devoted to
        R&amp;D and more specialized work.
 
        The Antenna Microwave Subsystem (AMS) accepts the received S-
        and X-band signals at the feed horn and transmits them
        through polarizer plates to an orthomode transducer.  The
        polarizer plates are adjusted so that the signals are
        directed to a pair of redundant amplifiers for each
        frequency, thus allowing simultaneous reception of signals in
        two orthogonal polarizations.  For S-band these are two Block
        IVA S-band Traveling Wave Masers (TWMs); for X-band the
        amplifiers are Block IIA TWMs.
 
        34-m STD Antennas: These antennas have two feed horns, one
        for S-band signals and one for X-band.  The horns are mounted
        on a cone which is fixed in relation to the subreflector.  A
        dichroic plate mounted above the horns directs energy from
        the subreflector into the proper horn.
 
        The AMS directs the received S- and X-band signals through
        polarizer plates and on to amplification.  There are two
        Block III S-band TWMs and two Block I X-band TWMs.
 
        34-m HEF Antennas: Unlike the other antennas, the 34-m HEF
        uses a single feed for both S- and X-band.  Simultaneous S-
        and X-band receive as well as X-band transmit is possible
        thanks to the presence of an S/X &apos;combiner&apos; which acts as a
        diplexer.  For S-band, RCP or LCP is user selected through a
        switch so neither a polarizer nor an orthomode transducer is
        needed.  X-band amplification options include two Block II
        TWMs or an HEMT Low Noise Amplifier (LNA).  S-band
        amplification is provided by an FET LNA.
 
 
      DSCC Receiver-Exciter Subsystem
      -------------------------------
        The Receiver-Exciter Subsystem is composed of three groups of
        equipment: the closed-loop receiver group, the open-loop
        receiver group, and the RF monitor group.  This subsystem is
        controlled by the Receiver-Exciter Controller (REC) which
        communicates directly with the DMC for predicts and OCI
        reception and status reporting.
 
        The exciter generates the S-band signal (or X-band for the
        34-m HEF only) which is provided to the Transmitter Subsystem
        for the spacecraft uplink signal.  It is tunable under
        command of the Digitally Controlled Oscillator (DCO) which
        receives predicts from the Metric Data Assembly (MDA).
 
        The diplexer in the signal path between the transmitter and
        the feed horn for all three antennas (used for simultaneous
        transmission and reception) may be configured such that it is
        out of the received signal path (in listen-only or bypass
        mode) in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the
        receiver system.
 
        Closed Loop Receivers: The Block IV receiver-exciter at the
        70-m stations allows for two receiver channels, each capable
        of L-Band (e.g., 1668 MHz frequency or 18 cm wavelength),
        S-band, or X-band reception, and an S-band exciter for
        generation of uplink signals through the low-power or
        high-power transmitter.  The Block III receiver-exciter at
        the 34-m STD stations allows for two receiver channels, each
        capable of S-band or X-band reception and an exciter used to
        generate an uplink signal through the low-power transmitter.
        The receiver-exciter at the 34-m HEF stations allows for one
        channel only.
 
        The closed-loop receivers provide the capability for rapid
        acquisition of a spacecraft signal and telemetry lockup.  In
        order to accomplish acquisition within a short time, the
        receivers are predict driven to search for, acquire, and
        track the downlink automatically.  Rapid acquisition
        precludes manual tuning though that remains as a backup
        capability.  The subsystem utilizes FFT analyzers for rapid
        acquisition.  The predicts are NSS generated, transmitted to
        the CMC which sends them to the Receiver-Exciter Subsystem
        where two sets can be stored.  The receiver starts
        acquisition at uplink time plus one round-trip-light-time or
        at operator specified times.  The receivers may also be
        operated from the LMC without a local operator attending
        them.  The receivers send performance and status data,
        displays, and event messages to the LMC.
 
        Either the exciter synthesizer signal or the simulation
        (SIM) synthesizer signal is used as the reference for the
        Doppler extractor in the closed-loop receiver systems,
        depending on the spacecraft being tracked (and Project
        guidelines).  The SIM synthesizer is not ramped; instead it
        uses one constant frequency, the Track Synthesizer Frequency
        (TSF), which is an average frequency for the entire pass.
 
        The closed-loop receiver AGC loop can be configured to one of
        three settings: narrow, medium, or wide.  It will be
        configured such that the expected amplitude changes are
        accommodated with minimum distortion.  The loop bandwidth
        (2BLo) will be configured such that the expected phase
        changes can be accommodated while maintaining the best
        possible loop SNR.
 
        Open-Loop Receivers: There are two types of Radio Science
        Open-Loop Receivers (OLR) in use.  At 70-m and 34-m HEF
        stations the OLR is a dedicated four channel, narrow-band
        receiver which provides amplified and downconverted video band
        signals to the DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP); it
        sometimes goes by the designation &apos;RIV&apos;.  At 34-m STD stations
        (DSS 42 and DSS 61) the OLR is an older system, the Multi-
        Mission Receiver (MMR), which provides two channels of narrow-
        band receiver output.  Both OLR systems are described in
        detail below under &apos;Electronics - DSN&apos;; here the overview
        continues only for the RIV system.
 
        The 70-m and 34-m HEF OLR utilizes a fixed first Local
        Oscillator (LO) frequency and a tunable second LO frequency
        to minimize phase noise and improve frequency stability.
        The OLR consists of an RF-to-IF downconverter located in
        the antenna, an IF selection switch (IVC), and a Radio
        Science IF-VF downconverter (RIV) located in the SPC.
        The RF-IF downconverters in the 70-m antennas are equipped
        for four IF channels: S-RCP, S-LCP, X-RCP, and X-LCP.  The
        34-m HEF stations are equipped with a two-channel RF-IF:
        S-band and X-band.  The IVC switches the IF input between
        the 70-m and 34-m HEF antennas.
 
        The RIV contains the tunable second LO, a set of video
        bandpass filters, IF attenuators, and a controller (RIC).
        The LO tuning is done via DSP control of the POCA/PLO
        combination based on a predict set.  The POCA is a
        Programmable Oscillator Control Assembly and the PLO is a
        Programmable Local Oscillator (commonly called the DANA
        synthesizer).  The bandpass filters are selectable via the
        DSP.  The RIC provides an interface between the DSP and the
        RIV.  It is controlled from the LMC via the DSP.  The RIC
        selects the filter and attenuator settings and provides
        monitor data to the DSP.  The RIC could also be manually
        controlled from the front panel in case the electronic
        interface to the DSP is lost.
 
        RF Monitor -- SSI and PPM: The RF monitor group of the
        Receiver-Exciter Subsystem provides spectral measurements
        using the Spectral Signal Indicator (SSI) and measurements of
        the received channel system temperature and spacecraft signal
        level using the Precision Power Monitor (PPM).
 
        The SSI provides a local display of the received signal
        spectrum at a dedicated terminal at the DSCC and routes these
        same data to the DSP which routes them to NOCC for remote
        display at JPL for real-time monitoring and RIV/DSP
        configuration verification.  These displays are used to
        validate Radio Science Subsystem data at the DSS, NOCC, and
        Mission Support Areas.  The SSI configuration is controlled
        by the DSP and a duplicate of the SSI spectrum appears on the
        LMC via the DSP.  During real-time operations the SSI data
        also serve as a quick-look science data type for Radio
        Science experiments.
 
        The PPM measures system noise temperatures (SNT) using a
        Noise Adding Radiometer (NAR) and downlink signal levels
        using the Signal Level Estimator (SLE).  The PPM accepts its
        input from the closed-loop receiver.  The SNT is measured by
        injecting known amounts of noise power into the signal path
        and comparing the total power with the noise injection &apos;on&apos;
        against the total power with the noise injection &apos;off.&apos; That
        operation is based on the fact that receiver noise power is
        directly proportional to temperature; thus measuring the
        relative increase in noise power due to the presence of a
        calibrated thermal noise source allows direct calculation of
        SNT.  Signal level is measured by calculating an FFT to
        estimate the SNR between the signal level and the receiver
        noise floor where the power is known from the SNT
        measurements.
 
        There is one PPM controller at the SPC which is used to
        control all SNT measurements.  The SNT integration time can
        be selected to represent the time required for a measurement
        of 30K to have a one-sigma uncertainty of 0.3K or 1%.
 
 
      DSCC Transmitter Subsystem
      --------------------------
        The Transmitter Subsystem accepts the S-band frequency
        exciter signal from the Block III or Block IV Receiver-
        Exciter Subsystem exciter and amplifies it to the required
        transmit output level.  The amplified signal is routed via
        the diplexer through the feed horn to the antenna and then
        focused and beamed to the spacecraft.
 
        The Transmitter Subsystem power capabilities range from 18 kw
        to 400 kw.  Power levels above 18 kw are available only at
        70-m stations.
 
 
      DSCC Tracking Subsystem
      -----------------------
        The Tracking Subsystem primary functions are to acquire and
        maintain communications with the spacecraft and to generate
        and format radiometric data containing Doppler and range.
 
        The DSCC Tracking Subsystem (DTK) receives the carrier
        signals and ranging spectra from the Receiver-Exciter
        Subsystem.  The Doppler cycle counts are counted, formatted,
        and transmitted to JPL in real time.  Ranging data are also
        transmitted to JPL in real time.  Also contained in these
        blocks is the AGC information from the Receiver-Exciter
        Subsystem.  The Radio Metric Data Conditioning Team (RMDCT)
        at JPL produces an Archival Tracking Data File (ATDF) which
        contains Doppler and ranging data.
 
        In addition, the Tracking Subsystem receives from the CMC
        frequency predicts (used to compute frequency residuals and
        noise estimates), receiver tuning predicts (used to tune the
        closed-loop receivers), and uplink tuning predicts (used to
        tune the exciter).  From the LMC, it receives configuration
        and control directives as well as configuration and status
        information on the transmitter, microwave, and frequency and
        timing subsystems.
 
        The Metric Data Assembly (MDA) controls all of the DTK
        functions supporting the uplink and downlink activities.  The
        MDA receives uplink predicts and controls the uplink tuning
        by commanding the DCO.  The MDA also controls the Sequential
        Ranging Assembly (SRA).  It formats the Doppler and range
        measurements and provides them to the GCF for transmission to
        NOCC.
 
        The Sequential Ranging Assembly (SRA) measures the round trip
        light time (RTLT) of a radio signal traveling from a ground
        tracking station to a spacecraft and back.  From the RTLT,
        phase, and Doppler data, the spacecraft range can be
        determined.  A coded signal is modulated on an uplink carrier
        and transmitted to the spacecraft where it is detected and
        transponded back to the ground station.  As a result, the
        signal received at the tracking station is delayed by its
        round trip through space and shifted in frequency by the
        Doppler effect due to the relative motion between the
        spacecraft and the tracking station on Earth.
 
 
      DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP)
      ----------------------------------------
        The DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP) located at the
        SPC digitizes and records the narrowband output data from
        the RIV.  It consists of a Narrow Band Occultation Converter
        (NBOC) containing four Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs),
        a ModComp CLASSIC computer processor called the Spectrum
        Processing Assembly (SPA), and several magnetic tape drives.
        Magnetic tapes containing DSP output are known as Original
        Data Records (ODRs).  Electronic near real-time data
        transmission (known as an Original Data Stream, or ODS) may
        be possible in certain circumstances.
 
        The DSP is operated through the LMC.  Using the
        SPA-Radioscience (SPA-R) software, the DSP allows for
        real-time frequency and time offsets (while in RUN mode)
        and, if necessary, snap tuning between the two frequency
        ranges transmitted by the spacecraft: coherent and
        non-coherent.  The DSP receives Radio Science frequency
        predicts from the CMC, allows for multiple predict set
        archiving (up to 60 sets) at the SPA, and allows for manual
        predict generation and editing.  It accepts configuration
        and control data from the LMC, provides display data to the
        LMC, and transmits the signal spectra from the SSI as well
        as status information to NOCC and the Project Mission
        Support Area (MSA) via the GCF data lines.  The DSP records
        the digitized narrowband samples and the supporting header
        information (i.e., time tags, POCA frequencies, etc.) on
        9-track magnetic tapes in 6250 or 1600 bpi GCR format.
 
        Through the DSP-RIC interface the DSP controls the RIV filter
        selection and attenuation levels.  It also receives RIV
        performance monitoring via the RIC.  In case of failure of
        the DSP-RIC interface, the RIV can be controlled manually
        from the front panel.
 
        All the RIV and DSP control parameters and configuration
        directives are stored in the SPA in a macro-like file called
        an &apos;experiment directive&apos; table.  A number of default
        directives exist in the DSP for the major Radio Science
        experiments.  Operators can create their own table entries.
 
        Items such as verification of the configuration of the prime
        open-loop recording subsystem, the selection of the required
        predict sets, and proper system performance prior to the
        recording periods will be checked in real-time at JPL via the
        NOCC displays using primarily the remote SSI display at NOCC
        and the NRV displays.  Because of this, transmission of the
        DSP/SSI monitor information is enabled prior to the start of
        recording.  The specific run time and tape recording times
        will be identified in the Sequence of Events (SOE) and/or DSN
        Keyword File.
 
        The DSP can be used to duplicate ODRs.  It also has the
        capability to play back a certain section of the recorded
        data after conclusion of the recording periods.
 
 
      DSCC Frequency and Timing Subsystem
      -----------------------------------
        The Frequency and Timing Subsystem (FTS) provides all
        frequency and timing references required by the other DSCC
        subsystems.  It contains four frequency standards of which
        one is prime and the other three are backups.  Selection of
        the prime standard is done via the CMC.  Of these four
        standards, two are hydrogen masers followed by clean-up loops
        (CUL) and two are cesium standards.  These four standards all
        feed the Coherent Reference Generator (CRG) which provides
        the frequency references used by the rest of the complex.  It
        also provides the frequency reference to the Master Clock
        Assembly (MCA) which in turn provides time to the Time
        Insertion and Distribution Assembly (TID) which provides UTC
        and SIM-time to the complex.
 
        JPL&apos;s ability to monitor the FTS at each DSCC is limited to
        the MDA calculated Doppler pseudo-residuals, the Doppler
        noise, the SSI, and to a system which uses the Global
        Positioning System (GPS).  GPS receivers at each DSCC receive
        a one-pulse-per-second pulse from the station&apos;s (hydrogen
        maser referenced) FTS and a pulse from a GPS satellite at
        scheduled times.  After compensating for the satellite signal
        delay, the timing offset is reported to JPL where a database
        is kept.  The clock offsets stored in the JPL database are
        given in microseconds; each entry is a mean reading of
        measurements from several GPS satellites and a time tag
        associated with the mean reading.  The clock offsets provided
        include those of SPC 10 relative to UTC (NIST), SPC 40
        relative to SPC 10, etc.
 
 
    Optics - DSN
    ============
      Performance of DSN ground stations depends primarily on size of
      the antenna and capabilities of electronics.  These are
      summarized in the following set of tables.  Note that 64-m
      antennas were upgraded to 70-m between 1986 and 1989.
      Beamwidth is half-power full angular width.  Polarization is
      circular; L denotes left circular polarization (LCP), and R
      denotes right circular polarization (RCP).

               planetary radar system.  For telecommunications, the
               transmitting frequency would be in the range 7145-7190
               MHz, the power would typically be 20 kW, and the gain
               would be about 72.6 dB (70-m antenna).  When ground
               transmitters are used in spacecraft radio science
               experiments, the details of transmitter and antenna
               performance rarely impact the results.

      DSCC Open-Loop Receiver (RIV)
      -----------------------------
        The open loop receiver block diagram shown below is for the
        RIV system at 70-m and 34-m High-Efficiency (HEF) antenna
        sites.  Input signals at both S- and X-band are mixed to
        approximately 300 MHz by fixed-frequency local oscillators
        near the antenna feed.  Based on a tuning prediction file,
        the POCA controls the DANA synthesizer, the output of which
        (after multiplication) mixes the 300 MHz IF to 50 MHz for
        amplification.  These signals in turn are down converted and
        passed through additional filters until they yield Output
        with bandwidths up to 45 kHz.  The Output is digitally
        sampled and either written to magnetic tape or electronically
        transferred for further analysis.

        Reconstruction of the antenna frequency from the frequency of
        the signal in the recorded data can be achieved through use
        of one of the following formulas.  Filters are defined below.
 
   FSant=3*SYN+1.95*10^9+3*(790/11)*10^6+Frec        (Filter 4)
        =3*SYN+1.95*10^9+3*(790/11)*10^6-Fsamp+Frec  (Filters 1-3,5,6)
 
   FXant=11*SYN + 7.940*10^9 +   Fsamp - Frec        (Filter 4)
        =11*SYN + 7.940*10^9 - 3*Fsamp + Frec        (Filters 1,2,3,6)
 
    where
        FSant,FXant  are the antenna frequencies of the incoming
                      signals at S and X bands, respectively,
        SYN          is the output frequency of the DANA synthesizer,
                      commonly labeled the readback POCA frequency on
                      data tapes,
        Fsamp        is the effective sampling rate of the digital
                      samples, and
        Frec         is the apparent signal frequency in a spectrum
                      reconstructed from the digital samples.
 
           NB: For many of the filter choices (see below) the Output
               is that of a bandpass filter.  The sampling rates
               in the table below are sufficient for the bandwidth
               but not the absolute maximum frequency, and aliasing
               results.  The reconstruction expressions above are
               appropriate ONLY when the sample rate shown in the
               tables below is used.
 
      DSCC Open-Loop Receiver (MMR at DSS 5 and 61)
      ---------------------------------------------
        The open loop receiver block diagram shown below is for MMR
        systems at the 34-m Standard (STD) DSS 61 antenna site and at
        the DSS 5 JPL DSN facility.  Based on a tuning prediction
        file, the POCA controls the DANA synthesizer, the output of
        which (after multiplication) mixes input signals at both
        S- and X-band to fixed intermediate frequencies for
        amplification.  These signals in turn are down converted
        and passed through additional filters until they yield Output
        with bandwidths up to 45 kHz.  The Output is digitally
        sampled and either written to magnetic tape or electronically
        transferred for further analysis.

    Detectors - DSN
    ===============
 
      DSCC Open-Loop Receivers
      ------------------------
        Open-loop receiver output is detected in software by the
        radio science investigator.
 
 
      DSCC Closed-Loop Receivers

        Nominal carrier tracking loop threshold noise bandwidth at
        both S- and X-band is 10 Hz.  Coherent (two-way) closed-loop

    Calibration - DSN
    =================
      Calibrations of hardware systems are carried out periodically
      by DSN personnel; these ensure that systems operate at required
      performance levels -- for example, that antenna patterns,
      receiver gain, propagation delays, and Doppler uncertainties
      meet specifications.  No information on specific calibration
      activities is available.  Nominal performance specifications
      are shown in the tables above.  Additional information may be
      available in [DSN810-5].
 
      Prior to each tracking pass, station operators perform a series
      of calibrations to ensure that systems meet specifications for
      that operational period.  Included in these calibrations is
      measurement of receiver system temperature in the configuration
      to be employed during the pass.  Results of these calibrations
      are recorded in (hard copy) Controller&apos;s Logs for each pass.
 
      The nominal procedure for initializing open-loop receiver
      attenuator settings is described below.  In cases where widely
      varying signal levels are expected, the procedure may be
      modified in advance or real-time adjustments may be made to
      attenuator settings.
 
 
      Open-Loop Receiver Attenuation Calibration
      ------------------------------------------
        The open-loop receiver attenuator calibrations are performed
        to establish the output of the open-loop receivers at a level
        that will not saturate the analog-to-digital converters.  To
        achieve this, the calibration is done using a test signal
        generated by the exciter/translator that is set to the peak
        predicted signal level for the upcoming pass.  Then the
        output level of the receiver&apos;s video band spectrum envelope
        is adjusted to the level determined by equation (3) below (to
        five-sigma).  Note that the SNR in the equation (2) is in dB
        while the SNR in equation (3) is linear.
 
          Pn = -198.6 + 10*log(SNT) + 10*log(1.2*Fbw)              (1)
 
          SNR = Ps - Pn                               (SNR in dB)  (2)
 
          Vrms = sqrt(SNR + 1)/[1 + 0.283*sqrt(SNR)]  (SNR linear) (3)
 
           where    Fbw = receiver filter bandwidth (Hz)
                    Pn  = receiver noise power (dBm)
                    Ps  = signal power (dBm)
                    SNT = system noise temperature (K)
                    SNR = predicted signal-to-noise ratio
 
 
    Operational Considerations - DSN
    ================================
      The DSN is a complex and dynamic &apos;instrument.&apos; Its performance
      for Radio Science depends on a number of factors from equipment
      configuration to meteorological conditions.  No specific
      information on &apos;operational considerations&apos; can be given here.
 
 
    Operational Modes - DSN
    =======================
 
      DSCC Antenna Mechanical Subsystem
      ---------------------------------
        Pointing of DSCC antennas may be carried out in several ways.
        For details see the subsection &apos;DSCC Antenna Mechanical
        Subsystem&apos; in the &apos;Subsystem&apos; section.  Binary pointing is
        the preferred mode for tracking spacecraft; pointing
        predicts are provided, and the antenna simply follows those.
        With CONSCAN, the antenna scans conically about the optimum
        pointing direction, using closed-loop receiver signal
        strength estimates as feedback.  In planetary mode, the
        system interpolates from three (slowly changing) RA-DEC
        target coordinates; this is &apos;blind&apos; pointing since there is
        no feedback from a detected signal.  In sidereal mode, the
        antenna tracks a fixed point on the celestial sphere.  In
        &apos;precision&apos; mode, the antenna pointing is adjusted using an
        optical feedback system.  It is possible on most antennas to
        freeze z-axis motion of the subreflector to minimize phase
        changes in the received signal.
 
 
      DSCC Receiver-Exciter Subsystem
      -------------------------------
        The diplexer in the signal path between the transmitter and
        the feed horns on all three antennas may be configured so
        that it is out of the received signal path in order to
        improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the receiver system.
        This is known as the &apos;listen-only&apos; or &apos;bypass&apos; mode.
 
 
      Closed-Loop vs. Open-Loop Reception
      -----------------------------------
        Radio Science data can be collected in two modes: closed-
        loop, in which a phase-locked loop receiver tracks the
        spacecraft signal, or open-loop, in which a receiver samples
        and records a band within which the desired signal presumably
        resides.  Closed-loop data are collected using Closed-Loop
        Receivers, and open-loop data are collected using Open-Loop
        Receivers in conjunction with the DSCC Spectrum Processing
        Subsystem (DSP).  See the Subsystems section for further
        information.
 
 
      Closed-Loop Receiver AGC Loop
      -----------------------------
        The closed-loop receiver AGC loop can be configured to one of
        three settings: narrow, medium, or wide.  Ordinarily it is
        configured so that expected signal amplitude changes are
        accommodated with minimum distortion.  The loop bandwidth is
        ordinarily configured so that expected phase changes can be
        accommodated while maintaining the best possible loop SNR.
 
 
      Coherent vs. Non-Coherent Operation
      -----------------------------------
        The frequency of the signal transmitted from the spacecraft
        can generally be controlled in two ways -- by locking to a
        signal received from a ground station or by locking to an
        on-board oscillator.  These are known as the coherent (or
        &apos;two-way&apos;) and non-coherent (&apos;one-way&apos;) modes, respectively.
        Mode selection is made at the spacecraft, based on commands
        received from the ground.  When operating in the coherent
        mode, the transponder carrier frequency is derived from the
        received uplink carrier frequency with a &apos;turn-around ratio&apos;
        typically of 240/221.  In the non-coherent mode, the
        downlink carrier frequency is derived from the spacecraft
        on-board crystal-controlled oscillator.  Either closed-loop
        or open-loop receivers (or both) can be used with either
        spacecraft frequency reference mode.  Closed-loop reception
        in two-way mode is usually preferred for routine tracking.
        Occasionally the spacecraft operates coherently while two
        ground stations receive the &apos;downlink&apos; signal; this is
        sometimes known as the &apos;three-way&apos; mode.
 
 
      DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP)
      ----------------------------------------
        The DSP can operate in four sampling modes with from 1 to 4
        input signals.  Input channels are assigned to ADC inputs
        during DSP configuration.  Modes and sampling rates are
        summarized in the tables below:

    Measurement Parameters - DSN
    ============================
 
      Open-Loop System
      ----------------
        Output from the Open-Loop Receivers (OLRs), as sampled and
        recorded by the DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP), is
        a stream of 8- or 12-bit quantized voltage samples.  The
        nominal input to the Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) is
        +/-10 volts, but the precise scaling between input voltages
        and output digitized samples is usually irrelevant for
        analysis; the digital data are generally referenced to a
        known noise or signal level within the data stream itself --
        for example, the thermal noise output of the radio receivers
        which has a known system noise temperature (SNT).  Raw
        samples comprise the data block in each DSP record; a header
        record (presently 83 16-bit words) contains ancillary
        information such as:
 
         time tag for the first sample in the data block
         RMS values of receiver signal levels and ADC outputs
         POCA frequency and drift rate
 
 
      Closed-Loop System
      ------------------
        Closed-loop data are recorded in Archival Tracking Data Files
        (ATDFs), as well as certain secondary products such as the
        Orbit Data File (ODF).  The ATDF Tracking Logical Record
        contains 117 entries including status information and
        measurements of ranging, Doppler, and signal strength.

    Instrument Description
    ======================
      The Voyager Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) is a modified
      version of the slow scan vidicon camera designs that were used
      in the earlier Mariner flights.  The system consists of two
      cameras, a high resolution Narrow Angle (NA) camera and a lower
      resolution, more sensitive Wide Angle (WA) camera.  Unlike the
      other on board instruments, operation of the cameras is not
      autonomous, but is controlled by an imaging parameter table
      residing in one of the spacecraft computers, the Flight Data
      Subsystem (FDS) (Voyager Science and Mission Systems Handbook,
      1987, JPL D-498, an internal JPL document available from JPL
      vellum files).
 
      The original mission was to Jupiter and Saturn.  Voyager
      surpassed expectations and Voyager 2 went on to encounter
      Uranus and Neptune.  As the Voyager mission progressed the
      objects photographed were further from the sun so they appear
      more faint even though longer exposures were used.  As the
      Voyager spacecrafts&apos; distance from the Earth increases, the
      telecommunications capability at each encounter decreases.  The
      difference in capabilities from the Jupiter and Saturn
      encounters and that at Uranus and Neptune was considerable.
      The reduced telecommunications capability limits the number of
      data modes that imaging can use.  Because of the diminished
      brightness of the objects being photographed, longer exposure
      times were used, many beyond the stated maximum of 15.360
      seconds.  Longer exposure times were all 48-second increments
      added to the maximum.  In addition, the camera was slewed in
      order to avoid smeared imaging.  The light flood state (on/off)
      was independent of the instrument mode.
 
 
    Science Objectives
    ==================
      The overall objective of this experiment is exploratory
      reconnaissance of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and their
      satellites and rings.  Such reconnaissance, at resolutions and
      phase angles unobtainable from Earth, provides much new data
      relevant to the atmospheric and/or surface properties of these
      bodies.  The experiment also has the following specific
      objectives: observe and characterize global circulation and
      meteorology; determine the horizontal and vertical structure of
      visible clouds; characterize the nature of any colored material
      which may be in clouds.
 
 
    Operational Considerations
    ==========================
      To make full scientific use of the image collection, it is
      necessary to understand the radiometric and geometric
      characteristics of the camera system and perform corrections to
      data.
 
      Each Voyager camera is unique in terms of its calibrated
      characteristics.  Each has intrinsic shading (spatially
      non-uniform output DNs from flat field target) and exhibits
      barrel distortions typical of TV cameras flown on previous
      planetary missions.  Because of these characteristics, the
      cameras were calibrated before launch.  The response of the
      pixels to known targets, illumination, exposures, etc.  was
      measured and Calibration Files were generated to remove
      radiometric and geometric distortions from the flight images.
      These Calibration Files and detailed information on their use
      are available through the Imaging Node.
 
 
    Calibration Description
    =======================
      The calibration program for the Voyager television cameras
      consisted of three parts: (1) component calibrations (&apos;Voyager
      Imaging Science Subsystem Calibration Report&apos; July 31, 1978, M.
      Benesh and P.  Jepsen, D618-802); (2) subsystem calibrations;
      and, (3) system calibrations.  In addition, provision was made
      for in-flight calibrations.  Component calibrations were
      carried out prior to camera assembly.  Important measurements
      include spectral transmittance of the lens and filters, actual
      exposure times and shading characteristics of the shutter, and
      pertinent electro-optical properties of the vidicon.  After the
      optics and sensor were assembled it was possible to run
      calibrations at the camera, or subsystem, level.  Particular
      activities accomplished during this period included radiometric
      calibrations, focal length measurement, determination of the
      modulation transfer function, measurement of the geometric
      distortion, and calibrations required for color reconstruction.
      System calibrations were conducted after the cameras were
      installed on the spacecraft.  Important tasks included
      measurement of the Field-Of-View alignment and verification of
      the flat-field light transfer characteristics.  Noise
      measurements were also made at the system level.
 
      A method for in-flight calibration was also available.  It
      consisted of a flat reflective surface which is located about 2
      m from the camera.  A flat-field light transfer curve can be
      constructed by orienting the spacecraft so that the plaque is
      illuminated by the sun and by photographing it at the proper
      exposure times.
 
      However, calibration data was collected but no new calibration
      files were generated during the Jupiter, Saturn, or Uranus
      encounters or their related cruise periods.
 
      Although the INSTRUMENT_PARAMETER_NAME has been provided as
      Radiance, the Voyager Experiment Data Record (EDR) data set has
      not been radiometrically corrected, and thus images do not
      represent radiance units.  In order to convert an image from
      Data Number (DN) to radiance units, the image must be
      calibrated.  Radiometric calibration files, and selected
      radiometrically corrected images are available through the
      Imaging Node.

      Description
      -----------
        The sensor used in the Voyager Imaging Science Subsystem
        (ISS) camera system is a 25 mm diameter magnetic deflection
        vidicon (number B41-003, General Electro-dynamics Co.).  The
        vidicon storage surface (target) is selenium sulphur and can
        store a high resolution (1500 TV lines) picture for over 100
        s at room temperature.  The active image area on the target
        is 11.14 x 11.14 mm.  Each frame consists of 800 lines with
        800 picture elements (pixels) per line, i.e., 1 pixel =14
        microns.  One frame requires 48 s for electronic readout.  In
        addition to the normal frame readout of 48 s (1:1), four
        extended frame-time modes of 2:1, 3:1, 5:1, and 10:1 are
        available by command.  Following readout, light flooding is
        used to remove any residual image that might remain from the
        previous frame.  At the end of light flooding, 14 erase
        frames are used to stabilize and prepare the vidicon target
        for the next exposure sequence (VGR ISS Calibration Report,
        1978, an internal JPL document available from JPL vellum
        files).
 
 
      Sensitivity
      -----------
        Calibration experiments show the gain map indicating higher
        sensitivity toward the top of the frame in a radial manner.
        Dark-current ratio results indicate a mean within
        plus-or-minus 3% of the true linearity of the light transfer
        function.  The required accuracy of the light-transfer
        functions was plus-or-minus 5% of half-scale signal averaged
        over any randomly selected area of 10 contiguous pixels.
        This requirement was consistently met for all Imaging Science
        Subsystem (ISS) flight cameras.  The radiance of the used
        light cannons was supposed to be plus-or-minus 5% or better
        of the level to produce a half-scale signal.  This criterion
        was also met.  It is not clear whether the color spatial
        dependence is due to the vidicon, or whether the filters have
        varying transmissions.  In the latter case, the ratios would
        be independent of light level; and this has been observed to
        be the case for all flight cameras.  Moreover, vidicons have
        not shown scale variations of this magnitude in the past, so
        that it is easier to believe that they are due to the
        spectral filters rather than to the vidicons.  The color
        sensitivity is sufficient to require a separate decalibration
        file for each spectral filter, which has been done, but not
        gross enough to cause concern about the quality of the image
        itself (VGR ISS Calibration Report, 1978, an internal JPL
        document available from JPL vellum files).
 
 
    Instrument Electronics &apos;ISSW&apos;
    =============================
 
      Description
      -----------
        The ISS electronics consist of the vidicon support circuits
        and the signal chain.  The vidicon support circuits are the
        vertical and horizontal sweep circuits, and the various power
        supplies for the vidicon filament, and the focus and
        alignment coils.  The signal chain consists of the analog
        signal amplifiers, bandpass filters, and an eight bit
        analog-to-digital converter.  The digital output is sent to
        the Flight Data Subsystem for editing.

      Description
      -----------
        Spectral measurements at the manufacturer were taken on
        Beckman spectro-photometers, and verifications at Jet
        Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) were made with a Cary 14
        spectro-photometer.  Each test scan was run from 2000 to 7000

        The measurements recorded below are the coordinates
        representing the center of the Wide Angle Field Of View (FOV)
        in relation to the center of the Narrow Angle FOV.  As of
        5/26/88 the Voyager 2 scan platform offset values were
        updated and the removal of all extraneous offset values for
        VG1 and VG2 accomplished.  Only the most recently input
        values remain in the database for each spacecraft.  These
        values are effective for all periods of data inclusive from
        launch to present.  (June 7, 1989).

    Instrument Description
    ======================
      The Voyager Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) is a modified
      version of the slow scan vidicon camera designs that were used
      in the earlier Mariner flights.  The system consists of two
      cameras, a high resolution Narrow Angle (NA) camera and a lower
      resolution, more sensitive Wide Angle (WA) camera.  Unlike the
      other on board instruments, operation of the cameras is not
      autonomous, but is controlled by an imaging parameter table
      residing in one of the spacecraft computers, the Flight Data
      Subsystem (FDS) (Voyager Science and Mission Systems Handbook,
      1987, JPL D-498, an internal JPL document available from JPL
      vellum files).
 
      The original mission was to Jupiter and Saturn.  Voyager
      surpassed expectations and Voyager 2 went on to encounter
      Uranus and Neptune.  As the Voyager mission progressed the
      objects photographed were further from the sun so they appear
      more faint even though longer exposures were used.  As the
      Voyager spacecrafts&apos; distance from the Earth increases, the
      telecommunications capability at each encounter decreases.  The
      difference in capabilities from the Jupiter and Saturn
      encounters and that at Uranus and Neptune was considerable.
      The reduced telecommunications capability limits the number of
      data modes that imaging can use.  Because of the diminished
      brightness of the objects being photographed, longer exposure
      times were used, many beyond the stated maximum of 15.360
      seconds.  Longer exposure times were all 48-second increments
      added to the maximum.  In addition, the camera was slewed in
      order to avoid smeared imaging.  The light flood state (on/off)
      was independent of the instrument mode.
 
 
    Science Objectives
    ==================
      The overall objective of this experiment is exploratory
      reconnaissance of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and their
      satellites and rings.  Such reconnaissance, at resolutions and
      phase angles unobtainable from Earth, provides much new data
      relevant to the atmospheric and/or surface properties of these
      bodies.  The experiment also has the following specific
      objectives: observe and characterize global circulation and
      meteorology; determine the horizontal and vertical structure of
      visible clouds; characterize the nature of any colored material
      which may be in clouds.
 
 
    Operational Considerations
    ==========================
      To make full scientific use of the image collection, it is
      necessary to understand the radiometric and geometric
      characteristics of the camera system and perform corrections to
      data.
 
      Each Voyager camera is unique in terms of its calibrated
      characteristics.  Each has intrinsic shading (spatially
      non-uniform output DNs from flat field target) and exhibits
      barrel distortions typical of TV cameras flown on previous
      planetary missions.  Because of these characteristics, the
      cameras were calibrated before launch.  The response of the
      pixels to known targets, illumination, exposures, etc.  was
      measured and Calibration Files were generated to remove
      radiometric and geometric distortions from the flight images.
      These Calibration Files and detailed information on their use
      are available through the Imaging Node.
 
 
    Calibration Description
    =======================
      The calibration program for the Voyager television cameras
      consisted of three parts: (1) component calibrations (&apos;Voyager
      Imaging Science Subsystem Calibration Report&apos; July 31, 1978, M.
      Benesh and P.  Jepsen, D618-802); (2) subsystem calibrations;
      and, (3) system calibrations.  In addition, provision was made
      for in-flight calibrations.  Component calibrations were
      carried out prior to camera assembly.  Important measurements
      include spectral transmittance of the lens and filters, actual
      exposure times and shading characteristics of the shutter, and
      pertinent electro-optical properties of the vidicon.  After the
      optics and sensor were assembled it was possible to run
      calibrations at the camera, or subsystem, level.  Particular
      activities accomplished during this period included radiometric
      calibrations, focal length measurement, determination of the
      modulation transfer function, measurement of the geometric
      distortion, and calibrations required for color reconstruction.
      System calibrations were conducted after the cameras were
      installed on the spacecraft.  Important tasks included
      measurement of the Field-Of-View alignment and verification of
      the flat-field light transfer characteristics.  Noise
      measurements were also made at the system level.
 
      A method for in-flight calibration was also available.  It
      consisted of a flat reflective surface which is located about 2
      m from the camera.  A flat-field light transfer curve can be
      constructed by orienting the spacecraft so that the plaque is
      illuminated by the sun and by photographing it at the proper
      exposure times.
 
      However, calibration data was collected but no new calibration
      files were generated during the Jupiter, Saturn, or Uranus
      encounters or their related cruise periods.
 
      Although the INSTRUMENT_PARAMETER_NAME has been provided as
      Radiance, the Voyager Experiment Data Record (EDR) data set has
      not been radiometrically corrected, and thus images do not
      represent radiance units.  In order to convert an image from
      Data Number (DN) to radiance units, the image must be
      calibrated.  Radiometric calibration files, and selected
      radiometrically corrected images are available through the
      Imaging Node.

      Description
      -----------
        The sensor used in the Voyager Imaging Science Subsystem
        (ISS) camera system is a 25 mm diameter magnetic deflection
        vidicon (number B41-003, General Electro-dynamics Co.).  The
        vidicon storage surface (target) is selenium sulphur and can
        store a high resolution (1500 TV lines) picture for over 100
        s at room temperature.  The active image area on the target
        is 11.14 x 11.14 mm.  Each frame consists of 800 lines with
        800 picture elements (pixels) per line, i.e., 1 pixel =14
        microns.  One frame requires 48 s for electronic readout.  In
        addition to the normal frame readout of 48 s (1:1), four
        extended frame-time modes of 2:1, 3:1, 5:1, and 10:1 are
        available by command.  Following readout, light flooding is
        used to remove any residual image that might remain from the
        previous frame.  At the end of light flooding, 14 erase
        frames are used to stabilize and prepare the vidicon target
        for the next exposure sequence (VGR ISS Calibration Report,
        1978, an internal JPL document available from JPL vellum
        files).
 
 
      Sensitivity
      -----------
        Calibration experiments show the gain map indicating higher
        sensitivity toward the top of the frame in a radial manner.
        Dark-current ratio results indicate a mean within
        plus-or-minus 3% of the true linearity of the light transfer
        function.  The required accuracy of the light-transfer
        functions was plus-or-minus 5% of half-scale signal averaged
        over any randomly selected area of 10 contiguous pixels.
        This requirement was consistently met for all Imaging Science
        Subsystem (ISS) flight cameras.  The radiance of the used
        light cannons was supposed to be plus-or-minus 5% or better
        of the level to produce a half-scale signal.  This criterion
        was also met.  It is not clear whether the color spatial
        dependence is due to the vidicon, or whether the filters have
        varying transmissions.  In the latter case, the ratios would
        be independent of light level; and this has been observed to
        be the case for all flight cameras.  Moreover, vidicons have
        not shown scale variations of this magnitude in the past, so
        that it is easier to believe that they are due to the
        spectral filters rather than to the vidicons.  The color
        sensitivity is sufficient to require a separate decalibration
        file for each spectral filter, which has been done, but not
        gross enough to cause concern about the quality of the image
        itself (VGR ISS Calibration Report, 1978, an internal JPL
        document available from JPL vellum files).
 
 
    Instrument Electronics &apos;ISSW&apos;
    =============================
 
      Description
      -----------
        The ISS electronics consist of the vidicon support circuits
        and the signal chain.  The vidicon support circuits are the
        vertical and horizontal sweep circuits, and the various power
        supplies for the vidicon filament, and the focus and
        alignment coils.  The signal chain consists of the analog
        signal amplifiers, bandpass filters, and an eight bit
        analog-to-digital converter.  The digital output is sent to
        the Flight Data Subsystem for editing.

  Science Objectives
  ==================
    The Planetary Radio Astronomy (PRA) experiments&apos; primary
    objective was to locate and explain kilometric, hectometric,
    and decametric radio emissions from the planets; to measure
    plasma resonances near the giant planets; and to detect
    lightning on the giant planets.  The instrument was also
    successful at observing solar radio emissions from the
    perspective of the outer solar system.
 
    Radio emissions can be used to determine the rate of rotation
    of the inner core of a planet, to determine the existence of a
    magnetic field, and to search for magnetic anomalies.  Radio
    emissions are often the only remote diagnostic for interactions
    occurring in the portions of magnetospheres through which a
    spacecraft does not pass.  This is particularly true for the
    inner magnetosphere, which usually goes unsampled.
 
    Further information on the instrument and the investigations
    performed can be found in [WARWICKETAL1997].
 
 
  Instrument Description
  ======================
    The Voyager Planetary Radio Astronomy (PRA) instrument
    consisted of two superheterodyne receivers, one for the range
    from 1326.0 to 1.2 kHz (center frequency) and a second for the
    range 40.55 to 1.53 MHz (center frequency).  The channels are
    numbered so that the lowest frequency channel (1.2 kHz) is
    channel number 198.  Channels in the range 1 to 128 are
    referred to as &apos;high band&apos;, and the remaining channels as &apos;low
    band&apos;.  In low band, the channel spacing is 19.2 kHz.  In high
    band, the channel spacing is 307.2 kHz.
 
    The PRA receiver is driven by two orthogonal antennas mounted
    on the spacecraft body.  Each antenna element is made of BeCu
    hollow tubes 0.5 inches in diameter and is 10 meters in length.
    By combining the signals from the two antennas in a 90 degree
    hybrid, the PRA instrument can distinguish between the opposing
    states, left hand and right hand, of circular polarization of
    an incoming wave.
 
    The Planetary Radio Astronomy (PRA) receivers were calibrated
    under environmentally-controlled conditions and over the entire
    frequency and dynamic range of the instruments.  This
    calibration consisted in application of a known narrow-band
    signal across the inputs and recording the receiver outputs.
 
    The laboratory calibrations provided power levels for each data
    number (DN) and each frequency in terms of known inputs across
    the antenna terminals of each of the experiment&apos;s two
    monopoles.  Calibrations were carried out over a range of
    receiver temperatures, but in practice the stability of the
    receiver as a function of temperature and the stability of the
    temperature of the receiver as a function of mission phase and
    the status of the overall spacecraft were such that a single
    calibration for each DN at each frequency could be used.
 
    Receiver output levels were quantized.  The minimum value for
    the wave flux density was frequency dependent varying from
    5.E-20 W M**-2 Hz**-1 at frequencies below 1.5 MHz to 5.E-19 at
    frequencies above 1.5 MHz.  The maximum wave flux density was
    typically 50 dB above the minimum value.  The instrument noise
    level also was frequency dependent.  It was about 1.E-19 W
    M**-2 Hz**-1 below 1.5 MHz.  The noise at 10 MHz was still
    about 1E-19 W M**-2 Hz**-1, increased to about 1.E-17 W M**-2
    Hz**-1 at 25 MHz, and then decreased to an intermediate value
    at 40 MHz.
 
    The low-band and high-band operation of the receiver differ.
    In low-band the receiver operated with a sharply tuned filter
    only 1 kHz broad at the 3 dB points and in high-band, with a
    200 kHz filter.  The gain of the receivers was designed in such
    a way that the output increased discontinuously by 23 dB
    (corresponding to the 200:1 bandwidth ratio) between the lowest
    frequency of high-band and the highest frequency of low-band.
    This caused the instrument output to remain constant across the
    high-band to low-band transition point if its input was
    broadband noise.
 
    If unpolarized radiation fell orthogonally on each monopole,
    the total unpolarized flux density for signals below about 5
    MHz could be roughly estimated to be
 
    S = So (10**(m/1000)),
 
    where m was the channel reading in millibels and So is
 
    So = 1.5E-21 (W/Hz m**2).
 
    No reliable method for estimating the flux density exists for
    frequencies above 5 MHz due to the increasing effect of antenna
    resonances.
 
    Although the PRA instrument had 14 possible operating modes, in
    practice the mode called POLLO was used more than 95% of the
    time.  In POLLO, the receiver swept through all 198 channels in
    sequence from the highest frequency to the lowest.  At each
    frequency step, data were produced every 30 msec, consisting of
    25 msec of integration and 5 msec of switching and settling
    time.  Thus, a full sweep through all 200 channels took 6 sec
    (including 60 msec for two status words).  Between steps the 90
    degree hybrid was switched such that the receiver was sensitive
    to the alternate sense of circular polarization.  This toggling
    between left hand and right hand polarization itself alternated
    with each 6 sec receiver sweep.  Thus, for a given frequency, a
    pair of left hand and right hand measurements were 6 sec
    apart.

  Science Objectives
  ==================
    The Planetary Radio Astronomy (PRA) experiments&apos; primary
    objective was to locate and explain kilometric, hectometric,
    and decametric radio emissions from the planets; to measure
    plasma resonances near the giant planets; and to detect
    lightning on the giant planets.  The instrument was also
    successful at observing solar radio emissions from the
    perspective of the outer solar system.
 
    Radio emissions can be used to determine the rate of rotation
    of the inner core of a planet, to determine the existence of a
    magnetic field, and to search for magnetic anomalies.  Radio
    emissions are often the only remote diagnostic for interactions
    occurring in the portions of magnetospheres through which a
    spacecraft does not pass.  This is particularly true for the
    inner magnetosphere, which usually goes unsampled.
 
    Further information on the instrument and the investigations
    performed can be found in [WARWICKETAL1997].
 
 
  Instrument Description
  ======================
    The Voyager Planetary Radio Astronomy (PRA) instrument
    consisted of two superheterodyne receivers, one for the range
    from 1326.0 to 1.2 kHz (center frequency) and a second for the
    range 40.55 to 1.53 MHz (center frequency).  The channels are
    numbered so that the lowest frequency channel (1.2 kHz) is
    channel number 198.  Channels in the range 1 to 128 are
    referred to as &apos;high band&apos;, and the remaining channels as &apos;low
    band&apos;.  In low band, the channel spacing is 19.2 kHz.  In high
    band, the channel spacing is 307.2 kHz.
 
    The PRA receiver is driven by two orthogonal antennas mounted
    on the spacecraft body.  Each antenna element is made of BeCu
    hollow tubes 0.5 inches in diameter and is 10 meters in length.
    By combining the signals from the two antennas in a 90 degree
    hybrid, the PRA instrument can distinguish between the opposing
    states, left hand and right hand, of circular polarization of
    an incoming wave.
 
    The Planetary Radio Astronomy (PRA) receivers were calibrated
    under environmentally-controlled conditions and over the entire
    frequency and dynamic range of the instruments.  This
    calibration consisted in application of a known narrow-band
    signal across the inputs and recording the receiver outputs.
 
    The laboratory calibrations provided power levels for each data
    number (DN) and each frequency in terms of known inputs across
    the antenna terminals of each of the experiment&apos;s two
    monopoles.  Calibrations were carried out over a range of
    receiver temperatures, but in practice the stability of the
    receiver as a function of temperature and the stability of the
    temperature of the receiver as a function of mission phase and
    the status of the overall spacecraft were such that a single
    calibration for each DN at each frequency could be used.
 
    Receiver output levels were quantized.  The minimum value for
    the wave flux density was frequency dependent varying from
    5.E-20 W M**-2 Hz**-1 at frequencies below 1.5 MHz to 5.E-19 at
    frequencies above 1.5 MHz.  The maximum wave flux density was
    typically 50 dB above the minimum value.  The instrument noise
    level also was frequency dependent.  It was about 1.E-19 W
    M**-2 Hz**-1 below 1.5 MHz.  The noise at 10 MHz was still
    about 1E-19 W M**-2 Hz**-1, increased to about 1.E-17 W M**-2
    Hz**-1 at 25 MHz, and then decreased to an intermediate value
    at 40 MHz.
 
    The low-band and high-band operation of the receiver differ.
    In low-band the receiver operated with a sharply tuned filter
    only 1 kHz broad at the 3 dB points and in high-band, with a
    200 kHz filter.  The gain of the receivers was designed in such
    a way that the output increased discontinuously by 23 dB
    (corresponding to the 200:1 bandwidth ratio) between the lowest
    frequency of high-band and the highest frequency of low-band.
    This caused the instrument output to remain constant across the
    high-band to low-band transition point if its input was
    broadband noise.
 
    If unpolarized radiation fell orthogonally on each monopole,
    the total unpolarized flux density for signals below about 5
    MHz could be roughly estimated to be
 
    S = So (10**(m/1000)),
 
    where m was the channel reading in millibels and So is
 
    So = 1.5E-21 (W/Hz m**2).
 
    No reliable method for estimating the flux density exists for
    frequencies above 5 MHz due to the increasing effect of antenna
    resonances.
 
    Although the PRA instrument had 14 possible operating modes, in
    practice the mode called POLLO was used more than 95% of the
    time.  In POLLO, the receiver swept through all 198 channels in
    sequence from the highest frequency to the lowest.  At each
    frequency step, data were produced every 30 msec, consisting of
    25 msec of integration and 5 msec of switching and settling
    time.  Thus, a full sweep through all 200 channels took 6 sec
    (including 60 msec for two status words).  Between steps the 90
    degree hybrid was switched such that the receiver was sensitive
    to the alternate sense of circular polarization.  This toggling
    between left hand and right hand polarization itself alternated
    with each 6 sec receiver sweep.  Thus, for a given frequency, a
    pair of left hand and right hand measurements were 6 sec
    apart.

    Instrument Description
    ======================
      The Voyager Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) is a modified
      version of the slow scan vidicon camera designs that were used
      in the earlier Mariner flights.  The system consists of two
      cameras, a high resolution Narrow Angle (NA) camera and a lower
      resolution, more sensitive Wide Angle (WA) camera.  Unlike the
      other on board instruments, operation of the cameras is not
      autonomous, but is controlled by an imaging parameter table
      residing in one of the spacecraft computers, the Flight Data
      Subsystem (FDS) (Science and Mission Systems Handbook, 1987,
      JPL D-498, an internal JPL document available from the JPL
      vellum files).
 
      The original mission was to Jupiter and Saturn.  Voyager
      surpassed expectations and went on to encounter Uranus and
      Neptune.  As the Voyager mission progressed the objects
      photographed were further from the sun so they appear more
      faint even though longer exposures were used.  As the Voyager
      spacecrafts&apos; distance from the Earth increases, the
      telecommunications capability at each encounter decreases.  The
      difference in capabilities from the Jupiter and Saturn
      encounters and that at Uranus and Neptune was considerable.
      The reduced telecommunications capability limits the number of
      data modes that imaging can use.  Because of the diminished
      brightness of the objects being photographed, longer exposure
      times were used, many beyond the stated maximum of 15.360
      seconds.  Longer exposure times were all 48-second increments
      added to the maximum.  In addition, the camera was slewed in
      order to avoid smeared imaging.  The light flood state (on/off)
      was independent of the instrument mode.
 
 
    Science Objectives
    ==================
      The overall objective of this experiment is exploratory
      reconnaissance of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and their
      satellites and rings.  Such reconnaissance, at resolutions and
      phase angles unobtainable from Earth, provides much new data
      relevant to the atmospheric and/or surface properties of these
      bodies.  The experiment also has the following specific
      objectives: observe and characterize global circulation and
      meteorology; determine the horizontal and vertical structure of
      visible clouds; characterize the nature of any colored material
      which may be in clouds.
 
 
    Operational Considerations
    ==========================
      To make full scientific use of the imaging collection, it is
      necessary to understand the radiometric and geometric
      characteristics of the camera system and perform corrections to
      the data.
 
      Each Voyager camera is unique in terms of its calibrated
      characteristics.  Each has intrinsic shading (spatially
      non-uniform output DNs from flat field target) and exhibits
      barrel distortions typical of TV cameras flown on previous
      planetary missions.  Because of these characteristics, the
      cameras were calibrated before launch.  The response of the
      pixels to known targets, illumination, exposures, etc.  was
      measured and Calibration Files were generated to remove
      radiometric an geometric distortions from the flight images.
      These Calibration Files and detailed information on their use
      are available through the Imaging Node.
 
 
    Calibration Description
    =======================
      The calibration program for the Voyager television cameras
      consisted of three parts: (1) component calibrations (&apos;Voyager
      Imaging Science Subsystem Calibration Report&apos; July 31, 1978, M.
      Benesh and P.  Jepsen, D618-802); (2) subsystem calibrations;
      and, (3) system calibrations.  Component calibrations were
      carried out prior to camera assembly.  Important measurements
      include spectral transmittance of the lens and filters, actual
      exposure times and shading characteristics of the shutter, and
      pertinent electro-optical properties of the vidicon.  After the
      optics and sensor were assembled it was possible to run
      calibrations at the camera, or subsystem, level.  Particular
      activities accomplished during this period included radiometric
      calibrations, focal length measurement, determination of the
      modulation transfer function, measurement of the geometric
      distortion, and calibrations required for color reconstruction.
      System calibrations were conducted after the cameras were
      installed on the spacecraft.  Important tasks included
      measurement of the Field-Of-View (FOV) alignment and
      verification of the flat-field light transfer characteristics.
      Noise measurements were also made at the system level.
 
      A method for in-flight verification of the radiometric
      calibrations that were run on the ground is employed on the
      Narrow-Angle optics.  It is very similar to the scheme used on
      the Wide-Angle optics except that eight lamps are required.
      They are located just within the Field-Of-View around the
      periphery of the telescope aperture.  By either pulsing the
      lamps or leaving them on and varying the shutter exposure time
      a transfer curve may also be generated by using the calibration
      plaque.  The method is identical to that described for the
      wide-angle optics.  However, calibration data was collected but
      no new calibration files were generated during the Jupiter,
      Saturn, or Uranus encounters or their related cruise periods.
 
      Although the INSTRUMENT_PARAMETER_NAME has been provided as
      Radiance, the Voyager Experiment Data Record (EDR) data set has
      not been radiometrically corrected, and thus images do not
      represent radiance units.  In order to convert an image from
      Data Number (DN) to radiance units, the image must be
      calibrated.  Radiometric calibration files, and selected
      radiometrically corrected images are available through the
      Imaging Node.

      Description
      -----------
        The sensor used in the Voyager Imaging Science Subsystem
        (ISS) camera system is a 25-mm diameter magnetic deflection
        vidicon (number B41-003, General Electro-dynamics Co.).  The
        vidicon storage surface (target) is selenium sulphur and can
        store a high resolution (1500 TV lines) picture for over 100
        s at room temperature.  The active image area on the target
        is 11.14 x 11.14 mm.  Each frame consists of 800 lines with
        800 picture elements (pixels) per line, i.e., 1 pixel =14
        microns.  One frame requires 48 s for electronic readout.  In
        addition to the normal frame readout of 48 s (1:1), four
        extended frame-time modes of 2:1, 3:1, 5:1, and 10:1 are
        available by command.  Following readout, light flooding is
        used to remove any residual image that might remain from the
        previous frame.  At the end of light flooding, 14 erase
        frames are used to stabilize and prepare the vidicon target
        for the next exposure sequence (VGR ISS Calibration Report,
        1978, an internal JPL document available from JPL vellum
        files).
 
 
      Sensitivity
      -----------
        Calibration experiments show the gain map indicating higher
        sensitivity toward the top of the frame in a radial manner.
        Dark-current ratio results indicate a mean within
        plus-or-minus 3% of the true linearity of the light transfer
        function.  The required accuracy of the light transfer
        functions was plus-or-minus 5% of half-scale signal averaged
        over any randomly selected area of 10 contiguous pixels.
        This requirement was consistently met for all ISS flight
        cameras.  The radiance of the used light cannons was supposed
        to be plus-or-minus 5% or better of the level to produce a
        half-scale signal.  This criterion was also met.  It is not
        clear whether the color spatial dependence is due to the
        vidicon, or whether the filters have varying transmissions.
        In the latter case, the ratios would be independent of light
        level; and this has been observed to be the case for all
        flight cameras.  Moreover, vidicons have not shown scale
        variations of this magnitude in the past, so that it is
        easier to believe that they are due to the spectral filters
        rather than to the vidicons.  The color sensitivity is
        sufficient to require a separate decalibration file for each
        spectral filter, which has been done, but not gross enough to
        cause concern about the quality of the image itself (VGR ISS
        Calibration Report, 1978, an internal JPL document available
        from JPL vellum files).

        The Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) electronics consist of
        the vidicon support circuits and the signal chain.  The
        vidicon support circuits are the vertical and horizontal
        sweep circuits, and the various power supplies for the
        vidicon filament, and the focus and alignment coils.  The
        signal chain consists of the analog signal amplifiers,
        bandpass filters, and an eight bit analog-to-digital
        converter.  The digital output is sent to the Flight Data
        Subsystem (FDS) for editing.

        The measurements recorded below are the coordinates
        representing the center of the Wide Angle Field-Of-View (FOV)
        in relation to the center of the Narrow Angle FOV.  As of
        5/26/88 the Voyager 2 scan platform offset values were
        updated and the removal of all extraneous offset values for
        VG1 and VG2 accomplished.  Only the most recently input
        values remain in the database for each spacecraft.  These
        values are effective for all periods of data inclusive from
        launch to present.  (June 7, 1989).

    Instrument Description
    ======================
      The Voyager Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) is a modified
      version of the slow scan vidicon camera designs that were used
      in the earlier Mariner flights.  The system consists of two
      cameras, a high resolution Narrow Angle (NA) camera and a lower
      resolution, more sensitive Wide Angle (WA) camera.  Unlike the
      other on board instruments, operation of the cameras is not
      autonomous, but is controlled by an imaging parameter table
      residing in one of the spacecraft computers, the Flight Data
      Subsystem (FDS) (Science and Mission Systems Handbook, 1987,
      JPL D-498, an internal JPL document available from the JPL
      vellum files).
 
      The original mission was to Jupiter and Saturn.  Voyager
      surpassed expectations and went on to encounter Uranus and
      Neptune.  As the Voyager mission progressed the objects
      photographed were further from the sun so they appear more
      faint even though longer exposures were used.  As the Voyager
      spacecrafts&apos; distance from the Earth increases, the
      telecommunications capability at each encounter decreases.  The
      difference in capabilities from the Jupiter and Saturn
      encounters and that at Uranus and Neptune was considerable.
      The reduced telecommunications capability limits the number of
      data modes that imaging can use.  Because of the diminished
      brightness of the objects being photographed, longer exposure
      times were used, many beyond the stated maximum of 15.360
      seconds.  Longer exposure times were all 48-second increments
      added to the maximum.  In addition, the camera was slewed in
      order to avoid smeared imaging.  The light flood state (on/off)
      was independent of the instrument mode.
 
 
    Science Objectives
    ==================
      The overall objective of this experiment is exploratory
      reconnaissance of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and their
      satellites and rings.  Such reconnaissance, at resolutions and
      phase angles unobtainable from Earth, provides much new data
      relevant to the atmospheric and/or surface properties of these
      bodies.  The experiment also has the following specific
      objectives: observe and characterize global circulation and
      meteorology; determine the horizontal and vertical structure of
      visible clouds; characterize the nature of any colored material
      which may be in clouds.
 
 
    Operational Considerations
    ==========================
      To make full scientific use of the imaging collection, it is
      necessary to understand the radiometric and geometric
      characteristics of the camera system and perform corrections to
      the data.
 
      Each Voyager camera is unique in terms of its calibrated
      characteristics.  Each has intrinsic shading (spatially
      non-uniform output DNs from flat field target) and exhibits
      barrel distortions typical of TV cameras flown on previous
      planetary missions.  Because of these characteristics, the
      cameras were calibrated before launch.  The response of the
      pixels to known targets, illumination, exposures, etc.  was
      measured and Calibration Files were generated to remove
      radiometric an geometric distortions from the flight images.
      These Calibration Files and detailed information on their use
      are available through the Imaging Node.
 
 
    Calibration Description
    =======================
      The calibration program for the Voyager television cameras
      consisted of three parts: (1) component calibrations (&apos;Voyager
      Imaging Science Subsystem Calibration Report&apos; July 31, 1978, M.
      Benesh and P.  Jepsen, D618-802); (2) subsystem calibrations;
      and, (3) system calibrations.  Component calibrations were
      carried out prior to camera assembly.  Important measurements
      include spectral transmittance of the lens and filters, actual
      exposure times and shading characteristics of the shutter, and
      pertinent electro-optical properties of the vidicon.  After the
      optics and sensor were assembled it was possible to run
      calibrations at the camera, or subsystem, level.  Particular
      activities accomplished during this period included radiometric
      calibrations, focal length measurement, determination of the
      modulation transfer function, measurement of the geometric
      distortion, and calibrations required for color reconstruction.
      System calibrations were conducted after the cameras were
      installed on the spacecraft.  Important tasks included
      measurement of the Field-Of-View (FOV) alignment and
      verification of the flat-field light transfer characteristics.
      Noise measurements were also made at the system level.
 
      A method for in-flight verification of the radiometric
      calibrations that were run on the ground is employed on the
      Narrow-Angle optics.  It is very similar to the scheme used on
      the Wide-Angle optics except that eight lamps are required.
      They are located just within the Field-Of-View around the
      periphery of the telescope aperture.  By either pulsing the
      lamps or leaving them on and varying the shutter exposure time
      a transfer curve may also be generated by using the calibration
      plaque.  The method is identical to that described for the
      wide-angle optics.  However, calibration data was collected but
      no new calibration files were generated during the Jupiter,
      Saturn, or Uranus encounters or their related cruise periods.
 
      Although the INSTRUMENT_PARAMETER_NAME has been provided as
      Radiance, the Voyager Experiment Data Record (EDR) data set has
      not been radiometrically corrected, and thus images do not
      represent radiance units.  In order to convert an image from
      Data Number (DN) to radiance units, the image must be
      calibrated.  Radiometric calibration files, and selected
      radiometrically corrected images are available through the
      Imaging Node.

      Description
      -----------
        The sensor used in the Voyager Imaging Science Subsystem
        (ISS) camera system is a 25-mm diameter magnetic deflection
        vidicon (number B41-003, General Electro-dynamics Co.).  The
        vidicon storage surface (target) is selenium sulphur and can
        store a high resolution (1500 TV lines) picture for over 100
        s at room temperature.  The active image area on the target
        is 11.14 x 11.14 mm.  Each frame consists of 800 lines with
        800 picture elements (pixels) per line, i.e., 1 pixel =14
        microns.  One frame requires 48 s for electronic readout.  In
        addition to the normal frame readout of 48 s (1:1), four
        extended frame-time modes of 2:1, 3:1, 5:1, and 10:1 are
        available by command.  Following readout, light flooding is
        used to remove any residual image that might remain from the
        previous frame.  At the end of light flooding, 14 erase
        frames are used to stabilize and prepare the vidicon target
        for the next exposure sequence (VGR ISS Calibration Report,
        1978, an internal JPL document available from JPL vellum
        files).
 
 
      Sensitivity
      -----------
        Calibration experiments show the gain map indicating higher
        sensitivity toward the top of the frame in a radial manner.
        Dark-current ratio results indicate a mean within
        plus-or-minus 3% of the true linearity of the light transfer
        function.  The required accuracy of the light transfer
        functions was plus-or-minus 5% of half-scale signal averaged
        over any randomly selected area of 10 contiguous pixels.
        This requirement was consistently met for all ISS flight
        cameras.  The radiance of the used light cannons was supposed
        to be plus-or-minus 5% or better of the level to produce a
        half-scale signal.  This criterion was also met.  It is not
        clear whether the color spatial dependence is due to the
        vidicon, or whether the filters have varying transmissions.
        In the latter case, the ratios would be independent of light
        level; and this has been observed to be the case for all
        flight cameras.  Moreover, vidicons have not shown scale
        variations of this magnitude in the past, so that it is
        easier to believe that they are due to the spectral filters
        rather than to the vidicons.  The color sensitivity is
        sufficient to require a separate decalibration file for each
        spectral filter, which has been done, but not gross enough to
        cause concern about the quality of the image itself (VGR ISS
        Calibration Report, 1978, an internal JPL document available
        from JPL vellum files).

        The Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) electronics consist of
        the vidicon support circuits and the signal chain.  The
        vidicon support circuits are the vertical and horizontal
        sweep circuits, and the various power supplies for the
        vidicon filament, and the focus and alignment coils.  The
        signal chain consists of the analog signal amplifiers,
        bandpass filters, and an eight bit analog-to-digital
        converter.  The digital output is sent to the Flight Data
        Subsystem (FDS) for editing.

        The measurements recorded below are the coordinates
        representing the center of the Wide Angle Field-Of-View (FOV)
        in relation to the center of the Narrow Angle FOV.  As of
        5/26/88 the Voyager 2 scan platform offset values were
        updated and the removal of all extraneous offset values for
        VG1 and VG2 accomplished.  Only the most recently input
        values remain in the database for each spacecraft.  These
        values are effective for all periods of data inclusive from
        launch to present.  (June 7, 1989).

  Instrument Description
  ======================
    The Voyager Plasma Science experiment consists of four
    modulated Grid Faraday Cups, three (A, B, C) of which are
    positioned about the Telemetry Antenna Axis and generally point
    toward the Earth with the fourth (D) at a right angle to this
    direction.  Ion currents are sampled simultaneously in all four
    cups, electrons in the D-cup only.  The instrument has an
    energy/charge range of 10-5950 V.  Data is taken in four ways,
    high and low resolution ion modes and high and low energy
    electron modes with energy resolution varying between 3.6 and
    29%.  The integration time for each energy channel can be
    varied; 0.21 s/channel is used at Jupiter and Saturn.
    Supersonic flow can be observed only when one of the detectors
    points within 45 degrees of the plasma velocity, subsonic flow
    is observed at all orientations.  The current observations as a
    function of energy/charge allows determination of the plasma
    density, temperature, and velocity.
 
 
  Science Objectives
  ==================
    The objective of the Plasma Instrument is to characterize
    plasma conditions throughout the Voyager trajectory, in the
    solar wind, during the planetary encounters, and in the
    interstellar medium.
 
 
  Operational Considerations
  ==========================
    Each detector has an effective field of view which is a cone of
    half angle 45 degrees; the detector response falls off quickly
    at higher angles.  Thus, for the instrument to measure ion
    parameters in a supersonic or transonic plasma some of the
    detectors must look into the plasma flow.  Secondary ions and
    electrons produced within the detectors can also effect the
    measurements, especially if large fluxes of hot ions or
    electrons are present.  These effects are not well modeled are
    rarely significant.  The instrument does not measure
    composition, only energy/charge, so a model of plasma
    composition must be adopted to fit the ion data.  The choice of
    models can be unambiguous for large Mach number flow (M&gt;3) but
    is non-unique for lower Mach numbers.  After the Jupiter
    encounter the highest energy/charge channels of the A, B, and C
    detectors often contain spurious signal and currents in the
    upper half of the energy range should be examined carefully
    before use.
 
 
  Calibration Description
  =======================
    The instrument was calibrated at MIT using ion and electron
    beams and compared to output from other Faraday cups in the
    same beam.  Current levels are also calibrated in-flight by
    injecting known currents into the detectors with the modulators
    on and off.  Much theoretical modeling has been done on the
    response of the detectors to arbitrary plasma conditions.
    Contact the PI for more information.
 
 
  Detectors &apos;A&apos;, &apos;B&apos;, &apos;C&apos;, and &apos;D&apos;
  ================================
    Detector Type                  : FARADAY CUP
    Detector Aspect Ratio          : 0.000000
    Nominal Operating Temperature  : 278.000000
 
    The PLS instrument consists of four Faraday cups.  Three of
    these (A, B, C) are arranged in a cone whose central axis is
    parallel to the direction of the telemetry antenna.  The look
    direction of each of these cups is offset 20 degrees from the
    central axis.  Detector D has a look direction approximately
    perpendicular to the direction of the telemetry antenna.  Each
    detector consists of three modulator grids, six shield grids
    and a suppressor grid in front of the collector.  It measures
    ion currents in the range 10-5950 V.
 
    Depending on the integration time, the detectors measure
    current from a minimum of 3.e-14 to 2.e-13 AMPS up to a maximum
    of 6.e-8 AMPS.  The integration time for each energy channel
    can be varied from .03 to .93 seconds.  The time between
    successive spectra varies from 12 to 192 s.

  Electronics
  ===========
    Currents from the four detectors are amplified, filtered, and
    integrated using four different measurement chains.  A single
    8-bit logarithmic A-D converter samples the four outputs of the
    measurement chains and transfers the data to the spacecraft.
    The high voltage modulator supplies a DC pedestal and a super-
    imposed 400 HZ square wave modulation voltage.  For positive
    ions the modulator grids of all four detectors are driven in
    parallel.  A more complete description and block diagram of the
    instrument electronics is available in [BRIDGEETAL1977].
 
 
  Operating Modes
  ===============
    The four operating modes of Voyager PLS are listed below.
    Instrument power consumption is 8.1 W for all modes.
 
    E1: Low energy electron mode which measures the range 10-140 V
        with 16 contiguous channels.
 
    E2: High energy electron mode which measures the range 10-5950
        V with 16 contiguous channels.
 
    L:  Low-resolution ion mode which measures the range 10-5950 V
        with 16 contiguous channels.
 
    M:  High resolution ion mode which measures the range 10-5950
        V with 128 contiguous channels.
 
 
  Instrument Mounting
  ===================
    The PLS instrument is located on the Science Boom.  The center
    of the main detector cluster (A, B, C) points parallel to the
    spacecraft telemetry antenna and detector D is at right angles
    to this direction.

    Instrument Description
    ======================
      The Voyager 1 and 2 Ultraviolet Spectrometers are nearly
      identical instruments.  This discussion applies to both, except
      in a few instances in which important differences between the
      two are noted explicitly.  The Voyager 1 Ultraviolet
      Spectrometer (UVS) is a compact Wadsworth mounted objective
      grating spectrometer that covers the wavelength range of 0.0535
      to 0.1702 micron (0.0513 to 0.1680 micron for the Voyager 2
      UVS).  It records the entire spectrum within this range in a
      single exposure.  It has no moving parts.  A mechanical
      &apos;collimator&apos; consisting of a series of 13 aperture plates
      defines the main &apos;airglow&apos; field of view (FOV) of 0.10 degrees
      degrees full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) x 0.87 degrees in length.
      Light passing through the collimator strikes the concave
      diffraction grating at near normal incidence.  The grating
      disperses and focuses light onto a 1-d array detector that
      records individual photoevents.  An auxiliary field of view for
      solar occultation experiments is offset 20 degrees from the
      airglow field by a small mirror near the front of the
      collimator. Using this &apos;occultation port&apos;, the UVS can view the
      Sun without pointing the main field, and those of other
      coaligned instruments, directly at the Sun.  The occultation
      field is 0.25 FWHM x 0.87 degrees.  A sunshade prevents
      illumination of the main entrance aperture by the sun during
      occultation observations.
 
      The UVS has two spectral resolutions depending on the nature of
      the source.  An extended monochromatic source that fills the
      FOV ideally produces a triangular intensity distribution of 0.1
      degree FWHM.  (The actual response function is slightly rounded
      at the top and base, but a triangle is a satisfactory
      approximation for most applications.) The 0.1 degree
      corresponds to width of 3.5 anodes, or 0.0033 microns.  This
      inherent spectral resolution may often be improved by spectral
      analysis.  A monochromatic point source is imaged onto a width
      of about 1 anode for a practical resolution of about 0.0015
      microns.  Precise measurements of the relative response as a
      function of position within the FOV have been made by rastering
      the FOV across a star.  At wavelengths longward of 0.1350
      microns there is a slight (~10%) asymmetry in the response on
      either side of the center of the FOV.
 
      The effective sizes of the entrance apertures are (airglow
      port) 21.2 and (occultation port) 0.75 cm**2.
 
      The anode array is scanned at a rate of 3125 scans per second
      and the results are added into an internal memory.  The UVS
      transmits the contents of this memory to the flight data system
      (FDS) on command of the FDS.  The FDS retrieves values for a
      pair of channels each 5 msec, and so reads a complete spectrum
      from the UVS in 0.32 sec.  For the fastest transmitted data
      rate (OC-1, see below) used for occultation observations, this
      readout proceeds continuously, producing a series of spectra
      separated by 0.32 sec.  For lower data rates, the memory is
      read in bursts of 0.32 sec separated by the appropriate
      intervals.  During these intervals, the UVS integrates the
      spectrum in its internal memory.  As the data is transferred to
      the FDS it is logarithmically compressed from 16 to 10 bits.
 
      The FDS determines the rate at which spectra are read from the
      UVS after being integrated internally in the instrument memory.
      Most planetary observations are made at one of two data rates,
      OC-1 (0.32 sec spectra, for occultation measurements) and GS-3
      (3.84 sec spectra, for emission spectroscopy).  Slower rates
      are used from time to time.  Rates and their designations are:
 
          Name            Mode #           Integration time (sec)
            OC-1            1                0.32

      A description of the UVS investigation is given by
      [BROADFOOTETAL1977].  Performance and analysis techniques are
      described by [BROADFOOTETAL1981].
 
 
    Scientific Objectives
    =====================
      The primary goal of the UVS is to study the composition and
      structure of the atmospheres of the outer planets and their
      satellites.  Secondary goals include the study of
      magnetospheric particle populations, magnetosphere-atmosphere
      interactions, the composition and distribution of the
      interplanetary wind, determinations of the solar flux, and
      stellar astronomy.
 
 
    Operational Considerations
    ==========================
      The Voyager UVS instruments have operated nearly continuously
      since launch in 1977.  With the singular exception of a
      decrease in the Voyager 1 microchannel plates (MCP) gain, due
      to a high radiation-induced count rate during passage through
      the inner Jovian magnetosphere, both instruments have remained
      photometrically stable at a better than 3% level since 1977.
      In-flight performance of the UVS from launch through the 1979
      Jupiter encounters is reviewed in [BROADFOOTETAL1981] and an up
      to date description of astronomical observations is contained
      in [HOLBERG1990] and [LINICK&amp;HOLBERG1991].
 
 
    Calibration Description
    =======================
      Laboratory calibration of the UVS included measurements of:
 
          1) sensitivity at a number of wavelengths throughout the
             spectral range,
          2) response to scattered light,
          3) off-axis response, including collimator transmission
             function, and
          4) intrinsic dark count rate.
 
      In-flight calibration has included assessments of absolute
      sensitivity by comparisons with stars, and measurements of the
      FOV response profile using stars.
 
      Before the absolute calibration can be applied to a measured
      spectrum, three or four spectral analysis steps are required.
      These are flat field correction, dark count subtraction, and
      descattering, and (sometimes) sky background removal.
 
      Channel-to-channel variations in sensitivity result from
      variations in effective count threshold among channels.
      Applying a &apos;fixed pattern noise&apos; (FPN) correction adjusts the
      signal levels to their equivalents for a common threshold in
      all channels.  The FPN correction involves a channel-by-channel
      multiplication by a correction spectrum.  The correction
      spectra are different for Voyager 1 and Voyager 2.  In fact,
      two spectra are in use for Voyager 1.  The first is used for
      data acquired before Jupiter encounter and the second for data
      after encounter.  The two differ to account for changes in the
      response of the Voyager 1 UVS induced by its operation in the
      intense Jovian radiation environment.
 
      Channels 3 and 4 have large FPN corrections, i.e.  they are
      less sensitive than the others.  Therefore the statistical
      accuracy of the signal in these channels is lower than in the
      other channels.
 
 
      Dark Counts
      -----------
        In interplanetary space, detector dark counts arise mainly
        from effects of gamma radiation from the radioisotope
        thermoelectric generators that power the spacecraft.  The
        count rate is about 0.02 counts per channel per second.  The
        shape is approximately flat in wavelength, with a step near
        the edge of the filter in the detector.  The shape is
        accurately known from long observations of the calibration
        plate mounted on the spacecraft.  Almost no photon signal
        (except for a weak reflection of sky-background H Lyman
        alpha) is recorded during these observations.  The absolute
        level varies slightly with scan platform position, because
        rotating the scan platform changes the shielding mass between
        the UVS detector and the generators.  For data acquired
        outside a planetary magnetosphere, subtracting a scaled dark
        spectrum from a calibration plate observation is usually a
        satisfactory correction for dark counting.
 
        Within a planetary magnetosphere, the dark count rate can
        include contributions from high-energy particles.  For lower
        levels, scaling a calibration plate spectrum is again
        satisfactory, but for higher levels the shape of the dark
        spectrum changes and another method must be used to
        estimate dark levels.  The best alternative is to use a
        spectrum taken at nearly the same time with no significant
        source in the FOV.  Satellite observations often fill this
        need.
 
 
      Descattering
      ------------
        Light scattered within the instrument illuminates channels
        outside the ideal transmission function of the collimator.
        The effects of scattering are removed by a process called
        descattering.  Descattering is accomplished through the use
        of a matrix operator, a 126x126 element matrix which
        describes the response of detector channel &apos;j&apos; to the
        measured signal at channel &apos;i&apos;.  This scattering matrix is
        completely empirical, having been determined from laboratory
        measurements of 50 individual emission lines covering the
        entire passband.  Descattering is a linear operation.  Dark
        counts must be subtracted prior to descattering as the
        descattering algorithm is based on the assumption that only
        photon events are present.  Descattering will also correct
        for second order response.  Therefore, if the spectrum to be
        descattered contains artifacts, such as anomalously high or
        low counts in channels 3 or 4, a corresponding error will be
        introduced in the vicinity of both the first and second order
        positions.
 
 
      Sky Background Subtraction
      --------------------------
        When the UVS slit is not completely filled by the disk of a
        planet, the portion off the planet sees the sky background.
        Fortunately, in the far UV the sky is generally quite dark
        and diffuse starlight is seldom significant.  However, bright
        emissions at H Lyman alpha, Lyman beta, and He 0.0584 microns
        from the interplanetary medium (IPM) often must be taken into
        account.  These lines arise from strong solar chromospheric
        emission lines that are scattered from neutral H and He of
        the local interstellar medium.  The physics of this
        &apos;interstellar wind&apos; is complex and leads to emission which is
        inhomogeneous in space and variable in time.  The IPM
        responds to active regions of the solar chromosphere as the
        sun rotates.  This means that the sky brightness as seen by
        the UVS can change noticeably on time scale of days.  As with
        instrumental dark counts, there are two standard means of
        removing sky background: direct subtraction of an adjacent
        sky background suitably scaled, if available, and
        construction of a synthetic sky background spectrum.
 
 
      Calibration
      -----------
        Calibrating the spectra converts them from count units to
        absolute brightness units. This step has not been included in
        the data processing because the correct procedure depends on
        the type of source viewed. The data spectra represent count
        rates after correction for fixed pattern noise, a background
        subtraction, and descattering. Multiplying these spectra by
        one of the calibration spectra converts it to brightness
        units. There is a calibration spectrum corresponding to each
        of the two source types, namely point sources and extended
        sources.
 
        Point Source: Multiplying a data spectrum by the calibration
        spectrum VxPTCAL.TAB (x=1 for Voyager 1 and x=2 for Voyager 2)
        converts the spectrum from counts/(channel) to
        photons/(cm**2-Angstrom-time), where time is the integration
        time of the spectrum.
 
        Extended Source, continuum emission: Multiplying a data
        spectrum that has been normalized to an integration time of 1
        second by the calibration spectrum VxFLCAL.TAB (x=1 for
        Voyager 1 and 2 for Voyager 2) converts the spectrum from
        counts/(channel-second) to spectral brightness in units of
        Rayleighs/Angstrom for a source that fills the field of view.
 
        Extended Source, monochromatic emission: The finite spectral
        resolution (about 35 A) of the spectrograph must be considered
        in this case. For isolated lines (those that are not strongly
        blended with emissions at nearby wavelengths) it is sufficient
        to sum the channels that include light from the emission of
        interest (about 7 channels) and multiply by the appropriate
        calibration factor. This factor is the product of the
        dispersion (9.26 Angstroms/channel) and the value in
        VxFLCAL.TAB corresponding to the center channel of the
        wavelength of interest. The resulting quantity is the
        brightness of a monochromatic emission that fills the field of
        view. For more complex spectra that include blended emissions,
        the most accurate approach is spectral analysis by generating
        synthetic spectra. This technique uses an iterative approach
        to adjust an estimated brightness spectrum until the model
        spectrum computed from it matches the observed spectrum. The
        model can be fairly simple, but must include the triangular
        transmission profile of the collimator and the instrument
        sensitivity (calibration). The calibration factor described
        earlier in this paragraph is the correct one to use for this
        kind of synthesis.
 
 
        Calibration and spectral analysis issues are discussed by
        [HOLBERGETAL1982] and [HOLBERG1986].
 
 
    Platform Mounting Descriptions
    ==============================
      The UVS is mounted on the scan platform.  The instrument is
      approximately bore-sighted with the wide and narrow angle
      television cameras, and with the PPS and IRIS instruments.  The
      alignment of the fields is not perfect; the following table
      gives offsets of the centers of the UVS fields relative to the
      centers of the ISS Narrow Angle Camera fields of view.
      Elevation is positive to the right within the imaging field of
      view, and cross-elevation is positive downward.  The narrow axis
      of the UVS slit is aligned with the elevation direction.

    Instrument Detector &apos;SPECTROMETER&apos;
    ==================================
      The windowless, photoevent-counting detector consists of an
      electron multiplier, a pair of microchannel plates (MCP) in
      series, and a 128-element linear self-scanned readout array.
      Photoelectrons ejected at the front of the MCP stack are
      amplified by a factor of about 1E6, and the resulting charge
      pulse is collected by the anode array.  The 128 narrow aluminum
      anodes, each 3 mm long, are deposited on 0.1-mm centers for a
      collecting length (in the dispersion direction) of 13 mm.
 
      The anodes are accessed sequentially by a shift register and
      FET switches contained on the single integrated circuit.  The
      scanning circuitry discharges each anode into a charge
      sensitive preamplifier.  The charge pulse is digitized and the
      information added into a shift register memory consisting of
      128 16-bit words.  The 128-anode array consists of two separate
      interdigitated 64-anode arrays scanned by two shift registers.
      The shift registers and memory are driven by a 200 kHz clock,
      so that an individual anode is accessed every 320 microsecond.
      The detector scan rate is therefore about 3125 Hz.
 
      Wavelengths shorter than about 0.1250 micron strike the MCP
      directly.  Longer wavelengths first pass through a MgF2 filter
      with a semi-transparent photocathode of CuI.  This serves to
      boost the quantum efficiency at long wavelengths and to reduce
      the response to second-order light.
 
      The detector is heavily shielded to reduce its response to
      trapped particle radiation.  A description of the detector may
      be found in [BROADFOOT&amp;SANDEL1977].

    Instrument Electronics &apos;UVS&apos;
    ============================
      The UVS electronics is housed in an enclosure integral with the
      optical section of instrument.  Most of the electronics is in
      the base of the instrument, but clock drive generators for the
      anode array and the first stage of charge sensitive
      preamplification of the analog signal processing electronics
      are mounted in the detector housing so that they are near the
      anode array.  Elements of the electronics complement include:
 
           (1)  Low voltage power supply
           (2)  High voltage power supply
           (3)  Clock drive generator for the anode array
           (4)  Analog signal processing electronics including A/D
                conversion
           (5)  128x16 bit accumulation memory for spectrum
           (6)  FDS interface
 
      The FDS interface sends data to the FDS on demand and accepts
      mode commands from the FDS.  The mode commands set the level of
      the high voltage applied to the MCPs of the detector and set
      the mode of analog signal processing (pulse counting or
      integration).
 
      Radiation-hard electronics components were used where possible,
      and spot radiation shielding was used to reduce the fluence at
      certain critical elements.
 
 
    Instrument Optics &apos;UVS&apos;
    =======================
      The optical system consists mainly of the mechanical collimator
      and concave diffraction grating.  The 13 aperture plates of the
      collimator establish a field of 0.1x0.87 degree for the airglow
      field and 0.25x0.87 degree for the occultation field.  The 0.1
      and 0.25 degree dimensions are in the dispersion direction, and
      the 0.87 degree dimension is in the cross-dispersion direction.
      The collimator provides separate light paths for the airglow
      and occultation ports, and a small mirror diverts the
      occultation field by 20 degrees from the airglow field.
 
      The concave diffraction grating is a platinum coated replica,
      ruled at 540 lines/mm, blazed at 0.0800 microns and having a
      spherical radius of curvature of 400.1 mm.  Dispersion in the
      image plane is 0.00926 microns/mm, or 0.000926 microns/channel.
      The grating substrate is a 4x6-cm rectangle, and the useful
      ruled area is 21 square cm.

    Instrument Mode &apos;PULSE COUNTING&apos;
    ================================
      Two modes of electrical operation allow the detector to operate
      in a photon-counting mode for low source intensities, or in an
      integration mode for high source intensities.  In the pulse
      counting mode, the number in the corresponding memory location
      is incremented by one if a charge above a fixed threshold is
      detected on an anode.  The access time of 320 microsec implies
      that single random photoevents can be recorded on any one of
      the anodes at a rate of about 300 Hz with a coincidence of 10%.
      The pulse-counting mode is used for all measurements except
      solar occultations.

    Instrument Mode &apos;PULSE INTEGRATION&apos;
    ===================================
      In the pulse integration mode a 3-bit A-to-D converter is
      introduced ahead of the adder.  In this case the charge on each
      anode is coarsely digitized and added to the previously
      accumulated signal in memory.  The statistics of sampling these
      events is complicated by the logarithmic pulse height
      distribution of the events.  There is also a logarithmic
      current limit function of the MCPs at the high event rates that
      normally obtain when this mode is used.  Because both these
      characteristics lead to non-linear response, modeling of the
      detector response is needed to restore linearity.  The
      integration mode is used for observing solar occultations.

    Instrument Description
    ======================
      The Voyager 1 and 2 Ultraviolet Spectrometers are nearly
      identical instruments.  This discussion applies to both, except
      in a few instances in which important differences between the
      two are noted explicitly.  The Voyager 1 Ultraviolet
      Spectrometer (UVS) is a compact Wadsworth mounted objective
      grating spectrometer that covers the wavelength range of 0.0535
      to 0.1702 micron (0.0513 to 0.1680 micron for the Voyager 2
      UVS).  It records the entire spectrum within this range in a
      single exposure.  It has no moving parts.  A mechanical
      &apos;collimator&apos; consisting of a series of 13 aperture plates
      defines the main &apos;airglow&apos; field of view (FOV) of 0.10 degrees
      degrees full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) x 0.87 degrees in length.
      Light passing through the collimator strikes the concave
      diffraction grating at near normal incidence.  The grating
      disperses and focuses light onto a 1-d array detector that
      records individual photoevents.  An auxiliary field of view for
      solar occultation experiments is offset 20 degrees from the
      airglow field by a small mirror near the front of the
      collimator. Using this &apos;occultation port&apos;, the UVS can view the
      Sun without pointing the main field, and those of other
      coaligned instruments, directly at the Sun.  The occultation
      field is 0.25 FWHM x 0.87 degrees.  A sunshade prevents
      illumination of the main entrance aperture by the sun during
      occultation observations.
 
      The UVS has two spectral resolutions depending on the nature of
      the source.  An extended monochromatic source that fills the
      FOV ideally produces a triangular intensity distribution of 0.1
      degree FWHM.  (The actual response function is slightly rounded
      at the top and base, but a triangle is a satisfactory
      approximation for most applications.) The 0.1 degree
      corresponds to width of 3.5 anodes, or 0.0033 microns.  This
      inherent spectral resolution may often be improved by spectral
      analysis.  A monochromatic point source is imaged onto a width
      of about 1 anode for a practical resolution of about 0.0015
      microns.  Precise measurements of the relative response as a
      function of position within the FOV have been made by rastering
      the FOV across a star.  At wavelengths longward of 0.1350
      microns there is a slight (~10%) asymmetry in the response on
      either side of the center of the FOV.
 
      The effective sizes of the entrance apertures are (airglow
      port) 21.2 and (occultation port) 0.75 cm**2.
 
      The anode array is scanned at a rate of 3125 scans per second
      and the results are added into an internal memory.  The UVS
      transmits the contents of this memory to the flight data system
      (FDS) on command of the FDS.  The FDS retrieves values for a
      pair of channels each 5 msec, and so reads a complete spectrum
      from the UVS in 0.32 sec.  For the fastest transmitted data
      rate (OC-1, see below) used for occultation observations, this
      readout proceeds continuously, producing a series of spectra
      separated by 0.32 sec.  For lower data rates, the memory is
      read in bursts of 0.32 sec separated by the appropriate
      intervals.  During these intervals, the UVS integrates the
      spectrum in its internal memory.  As the data is transferred to
      the FDS it is logarithmically compressed from 16 to 10 bits.
 
      The FDS determines the rate at which spectra are read from the
      UVS after being integrated internally in the instrument memory.
      Most planetary observations are made at one of two data rates,
      OC-1 (0.32 sec spectra, for occultation measurements) and GS-3
      (3.84 sec spectra, for emission spectroscopy).  Slower rates
      are used from time to time.  Rates and their designations are:
 
          Name            Mode #           Integration time (sec)
            OC-1            1                0.32
            GS-3            2                3.84
            CR-1            3                12

            UV-5A           10               3.84
 
      A description of the UVS investigation is given by
      [BROADFOOTETAL1977].  Performance and analysis techniques are
      described by [BROADFOOTETAL1981].
 
 
    Scientific Objectives
    =====================
      The primary goal of the UVS is to study the composition and
      structure of the atmospheres of the outer planets and their
      satellites.  Secondary goals include the study of
      magnetospheric particle populations, magnetosphere-atmosphere
      interactions, the composition and distribution of the
      interplanetary wind, determinations of the solar flux, and
      stellar astronomy.
 
 
    Operational Considerations
    ==========================
      The Voyager UVS instruments have operated nearly continuously
      since launch in 1977.  With the singular exception of a
      decrease in the Voyager 1 microchannel plates (MCP) gain, due
      to a high radiation-induced count rate during passage through
      the inner Jovian magnetosphere, both instruments have remained
      photometrically stable at a better than 3% level since 1977.
      In-flight performance of the UVS from launch through the 1979
      Jupiter encounters is reviewed in [BROADFOOTETAL1981] and an up
      to date description of astronomical observations is contained
      in [HOLBERG1990] and [LINICK&amp;HOLBERG1991].
 
 
    Calibration Description
    =======================
      Laboratory calibration of the UVS included measurements of:
 
          1) sensitivity at a number of wavelengths throughout the
             spectral range,
          2) response to scattered light,
          3) off-axis response, including collimator transmission
             function, and
          4) intrinsic dark count rate.
 
      In-flight calibration has included assessments of absolute
      sensitivity by comparisons with stars, and measurements of the
      FOV response profile using stars.
 
      Before the absolute calibration can be applied to a measured
      spectrum, three or four spectral analysis steps are required.
      These are flat field correction, dark count subtraction, and
      descattering, and (sometimes) sky background removal.
 
      Channel-to-channel variations in sensitivity result from
      variations in effective count threshold among channels.
      Applying a &apos;fixed pattern noise&apos; (FPN) correction adjusts the
      signal levels to their equivalents for a common threshold in
      all channels.  The FPN correction involves a channel-by-channel
      multiplication by a correction spectrum.  The correction
      spectra are different for Voyager 1 and Voyager 2.  In fact,
      two spectra are in use for Voyager 1.  The first is used for
      data acquired before Jupiter encounter and the second for data
      after encounter.  The two differ to account for changes in the
      response of the Voyager 1 UVS induced by its operation in the
      intense Jovian radiation environment.
 
      Channels 3 and 4 have large FPN corrections, i.e.  they are
      less sensitive than the others.  Therefore the statistical
      accuracy of the signal in these channels is lower than in the
      other channels.
 
 
      Dark Counts
      -----------
        In interplanetary space, detector dark counts arise mainly
        from effects of gamma radiation from the radioisotope
        thermoelectric generators that power the spacecraft.  The
        count rate is about 0.02 counts per channel per second.  The
        shape is approximately flat in wavelength, with a step near
        the edge of the filter in the detector.  The shape is
        accurately known from long observations of the calibration
        plate mounted on the spacecraft.  Almost no photon signal
        (except for a weak reflection of sky-background H Lyman
        alpha) is recorded during these observations.  The absolute
        level varies slightly with scan platform position, because
        rotating the scan platform changes the shielding mass between
        the UVS detector and the generators.  For data acquired
        outside a planetary magnetosphere, subtracting a scaled dark
        spectrum from a calibration plate observation is usually a
        satisfactory correction for dark counting.
 
        Within a planetary magnetosphere, the dark count rate can
        include contributions from high-energy particles.  For lower
        levels, scaling a calibration plate spectrum is again
        satisfactory, but for higher levels the shape of the dark
        spectrum changes and another method must be used to
        estimate dark levels.  The best alternative is to use a
        spectrum taken at nearly the same time with no significant
        source in the FOV.  Satellite observations often fill this
        need.
 
 
      Descattering
      ------------
        Light scattered within the instrument illuminates channels
        outside the ideal transmission function of the collimator.
        The effects of scattering are removed by a process called
        descattering.  Descattering is accomplished through the use
        of a matrix operator, a 126x126 element matrix which
        describes the response of detector channel &apos;j&apos; to the
        measured signal at channel &apos;i&apos;.  This scattering matrix is
        completely empirical, having been determined from laboratory
        measurements of 50 individual emission lines covering the
        entire passband.  Descattering is a linear operation.  Dark
        counts must be subtracted prior to descattering as the
        descattering algorithm is based on the assumption that only
        photon events are present.  Descattering will also correct
        for second order response.  Therefore, if the spectrum to be
        descattered contains artifacts, such as anomalously high or
        low counts in channels 3 or 4, a corresponding error will be
        introduced in the vicinity of both the first and second order
        positions.
 
 
      Sky Background Subtraction
      --------------------------
        When the UVS slit is not completely filled by the disk of a
        planet, the portion off the planet sees the sky background.
        Fortunately, in the far UV the sky is generally quite dark
        and diffuse starlight is seldom significant.  However, bright
        emissions at H Lyman alpha, Lyman beta, and He 0.0584 microns
        from the interplanetary medium (IPM) often must be taken into
        account.  These lines arise from strong solar chromospheric
        emission lines that are scattered from neutral H and He of
        the local interstellar medium.  The physics of this
        &apos;interstellar wind&apos; is complex and leads to emission which is
        inhomogeneous in space and variable in time.  The IPM
        responds to active regions of the solar chromosphere as the
        sun rotates.  This means that the sky brightness as seen by
        the UVS can change noticeably on time scale of days.  As with
        instrumental dark counts, there are two standard means of
        removing sky background: direct subtraction of an adjacent
        sky background suitably scaled, if available, and
        construction of a synthetic sky background spectrum.
 
 
      Calibration
      -----------
        Calibrating the spectra converts them from count units to
        absolute brightness units. This step has not been included in
        the data processing because the correct procedure depends on
        the type of source viewed. The data spectra represent count
        rates after correction for fixed pattern noise, a background
        subtraction, and descattering. Multiplying these spectra by
        one of the calibration spectra converts it to brightness
        units. There is a calibration spectrum corresponding to each
        of the two source types, namely point sources and extended
        sources.
 
        Point Source: Multiplying a data spectrum by the calibration
        spectrum VxPTCAL.TAB (x=1 for Voyager 1 and x=2 for Voyager 2)
        converts the spectrum from counts/(channel) to
        photons/(cm**2-Angstrom-time), where time is the integration
        time of the spectrum.
 
        Extended Source, continuum emission: Multiplying a data
        spectrum that has been normalized to an integration time of 1
        second by the calibration spectrum VxFLCAL.TAB (x=1 for
        Voyager 1 and 2 for Voyager 2) converts the spectrum from
        counts/(channel-second) to spectral brightness in units of
        Rayleighs/Angstrom for a source that fills the field of view.
 
        Extended Source, monochromatic emission: The finite spectral
        resolution (about 35 A) of the spectrograph must be considered
        in this case. For isolated lines (those that are not strongly
        blended with emissions at nearby wavelengths) it is sufficient
        to sum the channels that include light from the emission of
        interest (about 7 channels) and multiply by the appropriate
        calibration factor. This factor is the product of the
        dispersion (9.26 Angstroms/channel) and the value in
        VxFLCAL.TAB corresponding to the center channel of the
        wavelength of interest. The resulting quantity is the
        brightness of a monochromatic emission that fills the field of
        view. For more complex spectra that include blended emissions,
        the most accurate approach is spectral analysis by generating
        synthetic spectra. This technique uses an iterative approach
        to adjust an estimated brightness spectrum until the model
        spectrum computed from it matches the observed spectrum. The
        model can be fairly simple, but must include the triangular
        transmission profile of the collimator and the instrument
        sensitivity (calibration). The calibration factor described
        earlier in this paragraph is the correct one to use for this
        kind of synthesis.
 
 
        Calibration and spectral analysis issues are discussed by
        [HOLBERGETAL1982] and [HOLBERG1986].
 
 
    Platform Mounting Descriptions
    ==============================
      The UVS is mounted on the scan platform.  The instrument is
      approximately bore-sighted with the wide and narrow angle
      television cameras, and with the PPS and IRIS instruments.  The
      alignment of the fields is not perfect; the following table
      gives offsets of the centers of the UVS fields relative to the
      centers of the ISS Narrow Angle Camera fields of view.
      Elevation is positive to the right within the imaging field of
      view, and cross-elevation is positive downward.  The narrow axis
      of the UVS slit is aligned with the elevation direction.

    Instrument Detector &apos;SPECTROMETER&apos;
    ==================================
      The windowless, photoevent-counting detector consists of an
      electron multiplier, a pair of microchannel plates (MCP) in
      series, and a 128-element linear self-scanned readout array.
      Photoelectrons ejected at the front of the MCP stack are
      amplified by a factor of about 1E6, and the resulting charge
      pulse is collected by the anode array.  The 128 narrow aluminum
      anodes, each 3 mm long, are deposited on 0.1-mm centers for a
      collecting length (in the dispersion direction) of 13 mm.
 
      The anodes are accessed sequentially by a shift register and
      FET switches contained on the single integrated circuit.  The
      scanning circuitry discharges each anode into a charge
      sensitive preamplifier.  The charge pulse is digitized and the
      information added into a shift register memory consisting of
      128 16-bit words.  The 128-anode array consists of two separate
      interdigitated 64-anode arrays scanned by two shift registers.
      The shift registers and memory are driven by a 200 kHz clock,
      so that an individual anode is accessed every 320 microsecond.
      The detector scan rate is therefore about 3125 Hz.
 
      Wavelengths shorter than about 0.1250 micron strike the MCP
      directly.  Longer wavelengths first pass through a MgF2 filter
      with a semi-transparent photocathode of CuI.  This serves to
      boost the quantum efficiency at long wavelengths and to reduce
      the response to second-order light.
 
      The detector is heavily shielded to reduce its response to
      trapped particle radiation.  A description of the detector may
      be found in [BROADFOOT&amp;SANDEL1977].

    Instrument Electronics &apos;UVS&apos;
    ============================
      The UVS electronics is housed in an enclosure integral with the
      optical section of instrument.  Most of the electronics is in
      the base of the instrument, but clock drive generators for the
      anode array and the first stage of charge sensitive
      preamplification of the analog signal processing electronics
      are mounted in the detector housing so that they are near the
      anode array.  Elements of the electronics complement include:
 
           (1)  Low voltage power supply
           (2)  High voltage power supply
           (3)  Clock drive generator for the anode array
           (4)  Analog signal processing electronics including A/D
                conversion
           (5)  128x16 bit accumulation memory for spectrum
           (6)  FDS interface
 
      The FDS interface sends data to the FDS on demand and accepts
      mode commands from the FDS.  The mode commands set the level of
      the high voltage applied to the MCPs of the detector and set
      the mode of analog signal processing (pulse counting or
      integration).
 
      Radiation-hard electronics components were used where possible,
      and spot radiation shielding was used to reduce the fluence at
      certain critical elements.
 
 
    Instrument Optics &apos;UVS&apos;
    =======================
      The optical system consists mainly of the mechanical collimator
      and concave diffraction grating.  The 13 aperture plates of the
      collimator establish a field of 0.1x0.87 degree for the airglow
      field and 0.25x0.87 degree for the occultation field.  The 0.1
      and 0.25 degree dimensions are in the dispersion direction, and
      the 0.87 degree dimension is in the cross-dispersion direction.
      The collimator provides separate light paths for the airglow
      and occultation ports, and a small mirror diverts the
      occultation field by 20 degrees from the airglow field.
 
      The concave diffraction grating is a platinum coated replica,
      ruled at 540 lines/mm, blazed at 0.0800 microns and having a
      spherical radius of curvature of 400.1 mm.  Dispersion in the
      image plane is 0.00926 microns/mm, or 0.000926 microns/channel.
      The grating substrate is a 4x6-cm rectangle, and the useful
      ruled area is 21 square cm.

    Instrument Mode &apos;PULSE COUNTING&apos;
    ================================
      Two modes of electrical operation allow the detector to operate
      in a photon-counting mode for low source intensities, or in an
      integration mode for high source intensities.  In the pulse
      counting mode, the number in the corresponding memory location
      is incremented by one if a charge above a fixed threshold is
      detected on an anode.  The access time of 320 microsec implies
      that single random photoevents can be recorded on any one of
      the anodes at a rate of about 300 Hz with a coincidence of 10%.
      The pulse-counting mode is used for all measurements except
      solar occultations.

    Instrument Mode &apos;PULSE INTEGRATION&apos;
    ===================================
      In the pulse integration mode a 3-bit A-to-D converter is
      introduced ahead of the adder.  In this case the charge on each
      anode is coarsely digitized and added to the previously
      accumulated signal in memory.  The statistics of sampling these
      events is complicated by the logarithmic pulse height
      distribution of the events.  There is also a logarithmic
      current limit function of the MCPs at the high event rates that
      normally obtain when this mode is used.  Because both these
      characteristics lead to non-linear response, modeling of the
      detector response is needed to restore linearity.  The
      integration mode is used for observing solar occultations.

    Instrument Description
    ======================
      The Voyager Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) is a modified
      version of the slow scan vidicon camera designs that were used
      in the earlier Mariner flights.  The system consists of two
      cameras, a high resolution Narrow Angle (NA) camera and a lower
      resolution, more sensitive Wide Angle (WA) camera.  Unlike the
      other on board instruments, operation of the cameras is not
      autonomous, but is controlled by an imaging parameter table
      residing in one of the spacecraft computers, the Flight Data
      Subsystem (FDS) (Science and Mission Systems Handbook, 1987,
      JPL D-498, an internal JPL document available from JPL vellum
      files).
 
      The original mission was to Jupiter and Saturn.  Voyager
      surpassed expectations and went on to encounter Uranus and
      Neptune.  As the Voyager mission progressed the objects
      photographed were further from the sun so they appeared more
      faint even though longer exposures were used.  As the Voyager
      spacecrafts&apos; distance from the Earth increases, the
      telecommunications capability at each encounter decreases.  The
      difference in capabilities from the Jupiter and Saturn
      encounters and that at Uranus and Neptune was considerable.
      The reduced telecommunications capability limits the number of
      data modes that imaging can use.  Because of the diminished
      brightness of the objects being photographed, longer exposure
      times were used, many beyond the stated maximum of 15.360
      seconds.  Longer exposure times were all 48-second increments
      added to the maximum.  In addition, the camera was slewed in
      order to avoid smeared imaging.  The light flood state (on/off)
      was independent of the instrument mode.
 
 
    Science Objectives
    ==================
      The overall objective of this experiment is exploratory
      reconnaissance of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and their
      satellites and rings.  Such reconnaissance, at resolutions and
      phase angles unobtainable from Earth, provides much new data
      relevant to the atmospheric and/or surface properties of these
      bodies.  The experiment also has the following specific
      objectives: observe and characterize global circulation and
      meteorology; determine the horizontal and vertical structure of
      visible clouds; characterize the nature of any colored material
      which may be in clouds.
 
 
    Operational Considerations
    ==========================
      To make full scientific use of the image collection, it is
      necessary to understand the radiometric and geometric
      characteristics of the camera system and perform corrections to
      the data.
 
      Each Voyager camera is unique in terms of its calibrated
      characteristics.  Each has intrinsic shading (spatially
      non-uniform output DNs from flat field target) and exhibits
      barrel distortions typical of TV cameras flown on previous
      planetary missions.  Because of these characteristics, the
      cameras were calibrated before launch.  The response of pixels
      to known targets, illumination, exposures, etc.  was measured
      and Calibration Files were generated to remove radiometric and
      geometric distortions from the flight images.  These
      Calibration Files and detailed information on their use are
      available through the Imaging Node.
 
 
    Calibration Description
    =======================
      The calibration program for the Voyager television cameras
      consisted of three parts: (1) component calibrations (&apos;Voyager
      Imaging Science Subsystem Calibration Report&apos; July 31, 1978, M.
      Benesh and P.  Jepsen, D618-802); (2) subsystem calibrations;
      and, (3) system calibrations.  In addition, provision was made
      for in-flight calibrations.  Component calibrations were
      carried out prior to camera assembly.  Important measurements
      include spectral transmittance of the lens and filters, actual
      exposure times and shading characteristics of the shutter, and
      pertinent electro-optical properties of the vidicon.  After the
      optics and sensor were assembled it was possible to run
      calibrations at the camera, or subsystem, level.  Particular
      activities accomplished during this period included radiometric
      calibrations, focal length measurement, determination of the
      modulation transfer function, measurement of the geometric
      distortion, and calibrations required for color reconstruction.
      System calibrations were conducted after the cameras were
      installed on the spacecraft.  Important tasks included
      measurement of the Field-Of-View (FOV) alignment and
      verification of the flat-field light transfer characteristics.
      Noise measurements were also made at the system level.
 
      A method for in-flight calibration was also available.  It
      consisted of a flat reflective surface which is located about 2
      m from the camera.  A flat-field light transfer curve can be
      constructed by orienting the spacecraft so the at the plaque is
      illuminated by the sun and by photographing it at the proper
      exposure times.  However, calibration data was collected but no
      new calibration files were generated during either the Jupiter,
      Saturn, or Uranus encounters or their related cruise periods.
 
      Although the INSTRUMENT_PARAMETER_NAME has been provided as
      Radiance, the Voyager Experiment Data Record (EDR) data set has
      not been radiometrically corrected, and thus images do not
      represent radiance units.  In order to convert an image from
      Data Number (DN) to radiance units, the image must be
      calibrated.  Radiometric calibration files, and selected
      radiometrically corrected images are available through the
      Imaging Node.

      Description
      -----------
        The sensor used in the Voyager Imaging Science Subsystem ISS
        camera system is a 25mm diameter magnetic deflection vidicon
        (number B41-003, General Electro-dynamics Co.).  The vidicon
        storage surface (target) is selenium sulphur and can store a
        high resolution (1500 TV lines) picture for over 100 s at
        room temperature.  The active image area on the target is
        11.14 x 11.14 mm.  Each frame consists of 800 lines with 800
        picture elements (pixels) per line, i.e., 1 pixel = 14
        microns.  One frame requires 48 s for electronic readout.  In
        addition to the normal frame readout of 48 s (1:1), four
        extended frame-time modes of 2:1, 3:1, 5:1, and 10:1 are
        available by command.  Following readout, light flooding is
        used to remove any residual image that might remain from the
        previous frame.  At the end of light flooding, 14 erase
        frames are used to stabilize and prepare the vidicon target
        for the next exposure sequence (VGR ISS Calibration Report,
        1978, an internal JPL document available from JPL vellum
        files).
 
 
      Sensitivity
      -----------
        Calibration experiments show the gain map indicating higher
        sensitivity toward the top of the frame in a generally radial
        manner.  Dark-current ratio results indicate a mean within
        plus-or-minus 3% of the true linearity of the light transfer
        function.  The required accuracy of the light-transfer
        functions was plus-or-minus 5% of half-scale signal averaged
        over any randomly selected area of 10 contiguous pixels.
        This requirement was consistently met for all Imaging Science
        Subsystem (ISS) flight cameras.  The radiance of the used
        light cannons was supposed to be plus-or-minus 5% or better
        of the level to produce a half-scale signal.  This criterion
        was also met.  It is not clear whether the color spatial
        dependence is due to the vidicon, or whether the filters have
        varying transmissions.  In the latter case, the ratios would
        be independent of light level; and this has been observed to
        be the case for all flight cameras.  Moreover, vidicons have
        not shown scale variations of this magnitude in the past, so
        that it is easier to believe that they are due to the
        spectral filters rather than to the vidicons.  The color
        sensitivity is sufficient to require a separate decalibration
        file for each spectral filter, which has been done, but not
        gross enough to cause concern about the quality of the image
        itself (VGR ISS Calibration Report, 1978, an internal JPL
        document available from JPL vellum files).
 
 
    Instrument Electronics &apos;ISSW&apos;
    =============================
 
      Description
      -----------
        The Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) electronics consist of
        the vidicon support circuits and the signal chain.  The
        vidicon support circuits are the vertical and horizontal
        sweep circuits, and the various power supplies for the
        vidicon filament, and the focus and alignment coils.  The
        signal chain consists of the analog signal amplifiers,
        bandpass filters, and an eight bit analog-to-digital
        converter.  The digital output is sent to the Flight Data
        Subsystem (FDS) for editing.

        The measurements recorded below are the coordinates
        representing the center of the Wide Angle Field-Of-View (FOV)
        in relation to the center of the narrow angle FOV.  As of
        5/26/88 the Voyager 2 scan platform offset values were
        updated and the removal of all extraneous offset values for
        VG1 and VG2 accomplished.  Only the most recently input
        values remain in the database for each spacecraft.  These
        values are effective for all periods of data inclusive from
        launch to present.  (June 7, 1989).

    Instrument Description
    ======================
      The Voyager Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) is a modified
      version of the slow scan vidicon camera designs that were used
      in the earlier Mariner flights.  The system consists of two
      cameras, a high resolution Narrow Angle (NA) camera and a lower
      resolution, more sensitive Wide Angle (WA) camera.  Unlike the
      other on board instruments, operation of the cameras is not
      autonomous, but is controlled by an imaging parameter table
      residing in one of the spacecraft computers, the Flight Data
      Subsystem (FDS) (Science and Mission Systems Handbook, 1987,
      JPL D-498, an internal JPL document available from JPL vellum
      files).
 
      The original mission was to Jupiter and Saturn.  Voyager
      surpassed expectations and went on to encounter Uranus and
      Neptune.  As the Voyager mission progressed the objects
      photographed were further from the sun so they appeared more
      faint even though longer exposures were used.  As the Voyager
      spacecrafts&apos; distance from the Earth increases, the
      telecommunications capability at each encounter decreases.  The
      difference in capabilities from the Jupiter and Saturn
      encounters and that at Uranus and Neptune was considerable.
      The reduced telecommunications capability limits the number of
      data modes that imaging can use.  Because of the diminished
      brightness of the objects being photographed, longer exposure
      times were used, many beyond the stated maximum of 15.360
      seconds.  Longer exposure times were all 48-second increments
      added to the maximum.  In addition, the camera was slewed in
      order to avoid smeared imaging.  The light flood state (on/off)
      was independent of the instrument mode.
 
 
    Science Objectives
    ==================
      The overall objective of this experiment is exploratory
      reconnaissance of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and their
      satellites and rings.  Such reconnaissance, at resolutions and
      phase angles unobtainable from Earth, provides much new data
      relevant to the atmospheric and/or surface properties of these
      bodies.  The experiment also has the following specific
      objectives: observe and characterize global circulation and
      meteorology; determine the horizontal and vertical structure of
      visible clouds; characterize the nature of any colored material
      which may be in clouds.
 
 
    Operational Considerations
    ==========================
      To make full scientific use of the image collection, it is
      necessary to understand the radiometric and geometric
      characteristics of the camera system and perform corrections to
      the data.
 
      Each Voyager camera is unique in terms of its calibrated
      characteristics.  Each has intrinsic shading (spatially
      non-uniform output DNs from flat field target) and exhibits
      barrel distortions typical of TV cameras flown on previous
      planetary missions.  Because of these characteristics, the
      cameras were calibrated before launch.  The response of pixels
      to known targets, illumination, exposures, etc.  was measured
      and Calibration Files were generated to remove radiometric and
      geometric distortions from the flight images.  These
      Calibration Files and detailed information on their use are
      available through the Imaging Node.
 
 
    Calibration Description
    =======================
      The calibration program for the Voyager television cameras
      consisted of three parts: (1) component calibrations (&apos;Voyager
      Imaging Science Subsystem Calibration Report&apos; July 31, 1978, M.
      Benesh and P.  Jepsen, D618-802); (2) subsystem calibrations;
      and, (3) system calibrations.  In addition, provision was made
      for in-flight calibrations.  Component calibrations were
      carried out prior to camera assembly.  Important measurements
      include spectral transmittance of the lens and filters, actual
      exposure times and shading characteristics of the shutter, and
      pertinent electro-optical properties of the vidicon.  After the
      optics and sensor were assembled it was possible to run
      calibrations at the camera, or subsystem, level.  Particular
      activities accomplished during this period included radiometric
      calibrations, focal length measurement, determination of the
      modulation transfer function, measurement of the geometric
      distortion, and calibrations required for color reconstruction.
      System calibrations were conducted after the cameras were
      installed on the spacecraft.  Important tasks included
      measurement of the Field-Of-View (FOV) alignment and
      verification of the flat-field light transfer characteristics.
      Noise measurements were also made at the system level.
 
      A method for in-flight calibration was also available.  It
      consisted of a flat reflective surface which is located about 2
      m from the camera.  A flat-field light transfer curve can be
      constructed by orienting the spacecraft so the at the plaque is
      illuminated by the sun and by photographing it at the proper
      exposure times.  However, calibration data was collected but no
      new calibration files were generated during either the Jupiter,
      Saturn, or Uranus encounters or their related cruise periods.
 
      Although the INSTRUMENT_PARAMETER_NAME has been provided as
      Radiance, the Voyager Experiment Data Record (EDR) data set has
      not been radiometrically corrected, and thus images do not
      represent radiance units.  In order to convert an image from
      Data Number (DN) to radiance units, the image must be
      calibrated.  Radiometric calibration files, and selected
      radiometrically corrected images are available through the
      Imaging Node.

      Description
      -----------
        The sensor used in the Voyager Imaging Science Subsystem ISS
        camera system is a 25mm diameter magnetic deflection vidicon
        (number B41-003, General Electro-dynamics Co.).  The vidicon
        storage surface (target) is selenium sulphur and can store a
        high resolution (1500 TV lines) picture for over 100 s at
        room temperature.  The active image area on the target is
        11.14 x 11.14 mm.  Each frame consists of 800 lines with 800
        picture elements (pixels) per line, i.e., 1 pixel = 14
        microns.  One frame requires 48 s for electronic readout.  In
        addition to the normal frame readout of 48 s (1:1), four
        extended frame-time modes of 2:1, 3:1, 5:1, and 10:1 are
        available by command.  Following readout, light flooding is
        used to remove any residual image that might remain from the
        previous frame.  At the end of light flooding, 14 erase
        frames are used to stabilize and prepare the vidicon target
        for the next exposure sequence (VGR ISS Calibration Report,
        1978, an internal JPL document available from JPL vellum
        files).
 
 
      Sensitivity
      -----------
        Calibration experiments show the gain map indicating higher
        sensitivity toward the top of the frame in a generally radial
        manner.  Dark-current ratio results indicate a mean within
        plus-or-minus 3% of the true linearity of the light transfer
        function.  The required accuracy of the light-transfer
        functions was plus-or-minus 5% of half-scale signal averaged
        over any randomly selected area of 10 contiguous pixels.
        This requirement was consistently met for all Imaging Science
        Subsystem (ISS) flight cameras.  The radiance of the used
        light cannons was supposed to be plus-or-minus 5% or better
        of the level to produce a half-scale signal.  This criterion
        was also met.  It is not clear whether the color spatial
        dependence is due to the vidicon, or whether the filters have
        varying transmissions.  In the latter case, the ratios would
        be independent of light level; and this has been observed to
        be the case for all flight cameras.  Moreover, vidicons have
        not shown scale variations of this magnitude in the past, so
        that it is easier to believe that they are due to the
        spectral filters rather than to the vidicons.  The color
        sensitivity is sufficient to require a separate decalibration
        file for each spectral filter, which has been done, but not
        gross enough to cause concern about the quality of the image
        itself (VGR ISS Calibration Report, 1978, an internal JPL
        document available from JPL vellum files).
 
 
    Instrument Electronics &apos;ISSW&apos;
    =============================
 
      Description
      -----------
        The Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) electronics consist of
        the vidicon support circuits and the signal chain.  The
        vidicon support circuits are the vertical and horizontal
        sweep circuits, and the various power supplies for the
        vidicon filament, and the focus and alignment coils.  The
        signal chain consists of the analog signal amplifiers,
        bandpass filters, and an eight bit analog-to-digital
        converter.  The digital output is sent to the Flight Data
        Subsystem (FDS) for editing.

        The measurements recorded below are the coordinates
        representing the center of the Wide Angle Field-Of-View (FOV)
        in relation to the center of the narrow angle FOV.  As of
        5/26/88 the Voyager 2 scan platform offset values were
        updated and the removal of all extraneous offset values for
        VG1 and VG2 accomplished.  Only the most recently input
        values remain in the database for each spacecraft.  These
        values are effective for all periods of data inclusive from
        launch to present.  (June 7, 1989).

  Instrument Overview
  ===================
    As its name implies, the Cosmic Ray Subsystem (CRS) was
    designed for cosmic ray studies [STONEETAL1977B].  It consists
    of two high Energy Telescopes (HET), four Low Energy Telescopes
    (LET) and The Electron Telescope (TET).  The detectors have
    large geometric factors (~ 0.48 to 8 cm^2 ster) and long
    electronic time constants (~ 24 [micro]sec) for low power
    consumption and good stability.  Normally, the data are
    primarily derived from comprehensive ([Delta]E[1], [Delta]E[2]
    and E) pulse- height information about individual events.
    Because of the high particle fluxes encountered at Jupiter and
    Saturn, greater reliance had to be placed on counting rates in
    single detectors and various coincidence rates.  In
    interplanetary space, guard counters are placed in
    anticoincidence with the primary detectors to reduce the
    background from high-energy particles penetrating through the
    sides of the telescopes.  These guard counters were turned off
    in the Jovian magnetosphere when the accidental anticoincidence
    rate became high enough to block a substantial fraction of the
    desired counts.  Fortunately, under these conditions the
    spectra were sufficiently soft that the background, due to
    penetrating particles, was small.
 
    The data on proton and ion fluxes at Jupiter were obtained with
    the LET.  The thicknesses of individual solid-state detectors
    in the LET and their trigger thresholds were chosen such that,
    even in the Jovian magnetosphere, electrons made, at most, a
    very minor contribution to the proton counting rates
    [LUPTON&amp;STONE1972].  Dead time corrections and accidental
    coincidences were small (&lt; 20%) throughout most of the
    magnetotail, but were substantial (&gt; 50%) at flux maxima within
    40 R[J] Of Jupiter.  Data have been included in this package
    for those periods when the corrections are less than ~ 50% and
    can be corrected by the user with the dead time appropriate to
    the detector (2 to 25 [micro]sec).  The high counting rates,
    however, caused some baseline shift which may have raised
    proton thresholds significantly.  In the inner magnetosphere,
    the L[2] counting rate was still useful because it never rolled
    over.  This rate is due to 1.8- to 13-MeV protons penetrating
    L[1] (0.43 cm^2 ster) and &gt; 9-MeV protons penetrating the
    shield (8.4 cm^2 ster).  For an E^-2 spectrum, the two groups
    would make comparable contributions; but in the magnetosphere,
    for the E^-3 to E^-4 spectrum above 2.5 MeV [MCDONALDETAL1979],
    the contribution from protons penetrating the shield would be
    only 3 to 14%.
 
    The LET L[1]L[2]L[4] and L[1]L[2]L[3] coincidence-
    anticoincidence rates give the proton flux between 1.8 and 8
    MeV and 3 to 8 MeV with a small alpha particle contribution (~
    10^-3).  Corrections are required for dead time losses in L[1],
    accidental L[1]L[2] coincidences and anticoincidence losses
    from L[4].  Data are given only for periods when these
    corrections are relatively small.  The energy lost in detectors
    L[1], L[2] and L[3] was measured for individual particles.  For
    protons, this covered the energy range from 0.42 to 8.3 MeV.
    Protons can be identified positively by the [Delta]E vs.  E
    technique, their spectra obtained and accidental coincidences
    greatly reduced.  Because of telemetry limitations, however,
    only a small fraction of the events could be transmitted, and
    statistics become poor unless pulse-height data are averaged
    over a period of one hour.
 
    HET and LET detectors share the same data lines and pulse-
    height analyzers; thus, the telescopes can interfere with one
    another during periods of high counting rates.  To prevent such
    an interference and explore different coincidence conditions,
    the experiment was cycled through four operating modes, each
    192 seconds long.  Either the HETs or the LETs were turned on
    at a time.  LET-D was cycled through L[1] only and L[1]L[2]
    coincidence requirements.  The TET was cycled through various
    coincidence conditions, including singles from the front
    detectors.  At the expense of some time resolution, this
    procedure permitted us to obtain significant data in the outer
    magnetosphere and excellent data during the long passage
    through the magnetotail region.  Some of the published results
    from this experiment required extensive corrections for dead
    time, accidental coincidences and anticoincidences
    ([VOGTETAL1979A], [VOGTETAL1979B]; [SCHARDTETAL1981];
    [GEHRELSETAL1981]).  These corrections can be applied only on a
    case-by-case basis after a careful study of the environment and
    many self-consistency checks.  They cannot be applied on a
    systematic basis and we have no computer programs to do so;
    therefore, data from such periods are not included in the Data
    Center submission.  The scientists on the CRS team will,
    however, be glad to consider special requests if the desired
    information can be extracted from the data.

  Instrument Overview
  ===================
    As its name implies, the Cosmic Ray Subsystem (CRS) was
    designed for cosmic ray studies [STONEETAL1977B].  It consists
    of two high Energy Telescopes (HET), four Low Energy Telescopes
    (LET) and The Electron Telescope (TET).  The detectors have
    large geometric factors (~ 0.48 to 8 cm^2 ster) and long
    electronic time constants (~ 24 [micro]sec) for low power
    consumption and good stability.  Normally, the data are
    primarily derived from comprehensive ([Delta]E[1], [Delta]E[2]
    and E) pulse- height information about individual events.
    Because of the high particle fluxes encountered at Jupiter and
    Saturn, greater reliance had to be placed on counting rates in
    single detectors and various coincidence rates.  In
    interplanetary space, guard counters are placed in
    anticoincidence with the primary detectors to reduce the
    background from high-energy particles penetrating through the
    sides of the telescopes.  These guard counters were turned off
    in the Jovian magnetosphere when the accidental anticoincidence
    rate became high enough to block a substantial fraction of the
    desired counts.  Fortunately, under these conditions the
    spectra were sufficiently soft that the background, due to
    penetrating particles, was small.
 
    The data on proton and ion fluxes at Jupiter were obtained with
    the LET.  The thicknesses of individual solid-state detectors
    in the LET and their trigger thresholds were chosen such that,
    even in the Jovian magnetosphere, electrons made, at most, a
    very minor contribution to the proton counting rates
    [LUPTON&amp;STONE1972].  Dead time corrections and accidental
    coincidences were small (&lt; 20%) throughout most of the
    magnetotail, but were substantial (&gt; 50%) at flux maxima within
    40 R[J] Of Jupiter.  Data have been included in this package
    for those periods when the corrections are less than ~ 50% and
    can be corrected by the user with the dead time appropriate to
    the detector (2 to 25 [micro]sec).  The high counting rates,
    however, caused some baseline shift which may have raised
    proton thresholds significantly.  In the inner magnetosphere,
    the L[2] counting rate was still useful because it never rolled
    over.  This rate is due to 1.8- to 13-MeV protons penetrating
    L[1] (0.43 cm^2 ster) and &gt; 9-MeV protons penetrating the
    shield (8.4 cm^2 ster).  For an E^-2 spectrum, the two groups
    would make comparable contributions; but in the magnetosphere,
    for the E^-3 to E^-4 spectrum above 2.5 MeV [MCDONALDETAL1979],
    the contribution from protons penetrating the shield would be
    only 3 to 14%.
 
    The LET L[1]L[2]L[4] and L[1]L[2]L[3] coincidence-
    anticoincidence rates give the proton flux between 1.8 and 8
    MeV and 3 to 8 MeV with a small alpha particle contribution (~
    10^-3).  Corrections are required for dead time losses in L[1],
    accidental L[1]L[2] coincidences and anticoincidence losses
    from L[4].  Data are given only for periods when these
    corrections are relatively small.  The energy lost in detectors
    L[1], L[2] and L[3] was measured for individual particles.  For
    protons, this covered the energy range from 0.42 to 8.3 MeV.
    Protons can be identified positively by the [Delta]E vs.  E
    technique, their spectra obtained and accidental coincidences
    greatly reduced.  Because of telemetry limitations, however,
    only a small fraction of the events could be transmitted, and
    statistics become poor unless pulse-height data are averaged
    over a period of one hour.
 
    HET and LET detectors share the same data lines and pulse-
    height analyzers; thus, the telescopes can interfere with one
    another during periods of high counting rates.  To prevent such
    an interference and explore different coincidence conditions,
    the experiment was cycled through four operating modes, each
    192 seconds long.  Either the HETs or the LETs were turned on

    coincidence requirements.  The TET was cycled through various

    procedure permitted us to obtain significant data in the outer
    magnetosphere and excellent data during the long passage
    through the magnetotail region.  Some of the published results
    from this experiment required extensive corrections for dead
    time, accidental coincidences and anticoincidences
    ([VOGTETAL1979A], [VOGTETAL1979B]; [SCHARDTETAL1981];

    case-by-case basis after a careful study of the environment and
    many self-consistency checks.  They cannot be applied on a

      The following section on instrumentation has been extracted
      from the NSSDC documentation for the Voyager Cosmic Ray
      Subsystem (Reference_ID = NSSDCCRS1979).
 
      Instrument Overview
      ===================
 
      As its name implies, the Cosmic Ray Subsystem (CRS) was
      designed for cosmic ray studies [STONEETAL1977B]. It
      consists of two high Energy Telescopes (HET), four Low
      Energy Telescopes (LET) and The Electron Telescope (TET).
      The detectors have large geometric factors (~ 0.48 to 8
      cm^2 ster) and long electronic time constants (~ 24
      [micro]sec) for low power consumption and good stability.
      Normally, the data are primarily derived from
      comprehensive ([Delta]E[1], [Delta]E[2] and E) pulse-
      height information about individual events. Because of the
      high particle fluxes encountered at Jupiter and Saturn,
      greater reliance had to be placed on counting rates in
      single detectors and various coincidence rates. In
      interplanetary space, guard counters are placed in
      anticoincidence with the primary detectors to reduce the
      background from high-energy particles penetrating through
      the sides of the telescopes. These guard counters were
      turned off in the Jovian magnetosphere when the accidental
      anticoincidence rate became high enough to block a
      substantial fraction of the desired counts. Fortunately,
      under these conditions the spectra were sufficiently soft
      that the background, due to penetrating particles, was
      small.
 
      The data on proton and ion fluxes at Jupiter were obtained
      with the LET. The thicknesses of individual solid-state
      detectors in the LET and their trigger thresholds were
      chosen such that, even in the Jovian magnetosphere,
      electrons made, at most, a very minor contribution to the
      proton counting rates [LUPTON&amp;STONE1972]. Dead time
      corrections and accidental coincidences were small (&lt; 20%)
      throughout most of the magnetotail, but were substantial (&gt;
      50%) at flux maxima within 40 R[J] Of Jupiter. Data have
      been included in this package for those periods when the
      corrections are less than ~ 50% and can be corrected by the
      user with the dead time appropriate to the detector (2 to
      25 [micro]sec). The high counting rates, however, caused
      some baseline shift which may have raised proton thresholds
      significantly. In the inner magnetosphere, the L[2]
      counting rate was still useful because it never rolled
      over. This rate is due to 1.8- to 13-MeV protons
      penetrating L[1] (0.43 cm^2 ster) and &gt; 9-MeV protons
      penetrating the shield (8.4 cm^2 ster). For an E^-2
      spectrum, the two groups would make comparable
      contributions; but in the magnetosphere, for the E^-3 to
      E^-4 spectrum above 2.5 MeV [MCDONALDETAL1979], the
      contribution from protons penetrating the shield would be
      only 3 to 14%.
 
      The LET L[1]L[2]L[4] and L[1]L[2]L[3] coincidence-
      anticoincidence rates give the proton flux between 1.8 and
      8 MeV and 3 to 8 MeV with a small alpha particle
      contribution (~ 10^-3). Corrections are required for dead
      time losses in L[1], accidental L[1]L[2] coincidences and
      anticoincidence losses from L[4]. Data are given only for
      periods when these corrections are relatively small. The
      energy lost in detectors L[1], L[2] and L[3] was measured
      for individual particles. For protons, this covered the
      energy range from 0.42 to 8.3 MeV. Protons can be
      identified positively by the [Delta]E vs. E technique,
      their spectra obtained and accidental coincidences greatly
      reduced. Because of telemetry limitations, however, only a
      small fraction of the events could be transmitted, and
      statistics become poor unless pulse-height data are
      averaged over a period of one hour.
 
      HET and LET detectors share the same data lines and pulse-
      height analyzers; thus, the telescopes can interfere with
      one another during periods of high counting rates. To
      prevent such an interference and explore different
      coincidence conditions, the experiment was cycled through
      four operating modes, each 192 seconds long. Either the
      HETs or the LETs were turned on at a time. LET-D was cycled
      through L[1] only and L[1]L[2] coincidence requirements.
      The TET was cycled through various coincidence conditions,
      including singles from the front detectors. At the expense
      of some time resolution, this procedure permitted us to
      obtain significant data in the outer magnetosphere and
      excellent data during the long passage through the
      magnetotail region. Some of the published results from this
      experiment required extensive corrections for dead time,
      accidental coincidences and anticoincidences
      ([VOGTETAL1979A], [VOGTETAL1979B]; [SCHARDTETAL1981];
      [GEHRELSETAL1981]). These corrections can be applied only
      on a case-by-case basis after a careful study of the
      environment and many self-consistency checks. They cannot
      be applied on a systematic basis and we have no computer
      programs to do so; therefore, data from such periods are
      not included in the Data Center submission. The scientists
      on the CRS team will, however, be glad to consider special
      requests if the desired information can be extracted from
      the data.

    INSTRUMENT: INFRARED INTERFEROMETER SPECTROMETER AND RADIOMETER

                                        SPECTROMETER AND RADIOMETER
      Instrument Type                : INFRARED INTERFEROMETER
 
 
    Instrument Description
    ======================
      The Voyager IRIS instrument consists of a Michelson
      interferometer for measurements in the thermal infrared and a
      single channel radiometer that operates in the visible and near
      infrared.  The two components of the instrument share a 50 cm
      Cassegrain telescope with an effective focal length of 303.5
      cm.  The angular field of view is 0.25 degree.  Light passing
      through the telescope is divided into two beams by a dichroic
      mirror, with that longer than about 2.5 micrometers going to
      the infrared interferometer and radiation between 0.33 and 2
      micrometers going to the radiometer.  The effective spectral
      range of the interferometer is 180-2500 cm**-1 (4-55
      micrometers) and the apodized spectral resolution is 4.3
      cm**-1.  The beam splitter of the interferometer consists of a
      multilayer dielectric coating applied to a cesium iodide
      substrate.  The moving mirror is mounted on one end of a motor
      shaft; the moving mirror of an auxiliary reference
      interferometer is attached to the other end of the shaft.  A
      0.5852 micrometer neon line source is used for the reference
      interferometer; the signal from this unit is used by a phase
      comparator and digital sampling circuit to control the motor
      speed and to quantize the analog signal from the main IR
      detector.  The latter is a low impedance, Schwartz-type
      thermopile with a noise equivalent power (NEP) of about 2E-10
      Watt/Hz**1/2.
 
      The spectral response of the radiometer, which is designed to
      measure the broadband reflected solar radiation, is controlled
      by the dichroic mirror and an additional coating on the
      radiometer side of the mirror.  The radiometer detector is an
      eighteen-junction thermopile with an NEP of 4E-10 Watt/Hz**1/2.
      A sapphire window is placed in front of the detector to reject
      unwanted long-wave radiation that may result from temperature
      gradients within the instrument.  The signal from the
      radiometer detector is fed to a low noise, low-drift dc
      amplifier with a time constant of approximately 2.7 seconds,
      and then to three different output circuits.  The first circuit
      integrates the radiometer signal over the 45.6 seconds it takes
      to record an interferogram, thus providing the average of the
      reflected sunlight during the time the infrared spectrum is
      recorded.  The second and third circuits provide the analog
      signal from the radiometer as well as the signal amplified by a
      factor of 8.  These latter channels are sampled every 6 seconds
      and digitized.  The timing of the samples, and their
      relationship to events in a single-frame read out of an image
      are given in Table 1.

      In order to visualize the effects of quantization uncertainties
      directly, it is sometimes useful to convert the radiometer
      watts at the detector back into data numbers (DN).  The
      relationships are:
 
            For Voyager 1:
 
               Sampled data (normal gain):
                  DNn = (WADn * 1e+08 - 2.51937) / 3.39426
               Sampled data (high gain):
                  DNh = (WADh * 1e+09 - 1.55472) / 4.26206
               Integrated data:
                  DNi = WADi / 1.42145 * 1e+09
 
            For Voyager 2:
 
               Sampled data (normal gain):
                  DNn = (WADn * 1e+08 - 6.33020) / 3.40070
               Sampled data (high gain):
                  DNh = (WADh * 1e+09 + 6.57589) / 4.24459
               Integrated data:
                  DNi = WADi / 1.42047 * 1e+09
 
 
      Pairs of baseline levels are averaged at the beginning and at
      the end of the 45.6 second integrations, occasionally resulting
      in half-integral DN values for the integrated radiometer data.
 
      Despite the stability of the calibration data (see below), a
      small systematic error may remain.  Comparison of spatially
      resolved IRIS observations of Jupiter and Saturn shows that
      reflectivities derived from Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 IRIS
      instruments are in the ratio 0.883:1.  An investigation was
      made of albedos of various objects (Jupiter, Io, Ganymede,
      Callisto, and Saturn), as determined using the two instruments.
      When compared to groundbased determinations, no systematic
      differences were apparent for either instrument, within the
      uncertainties.  Thus, a systematic error on the order of 10%
      may exist in the calibration of one or both of the IRIS
      instruments&apos; radiometer systems.
 
      The temperature of the instrument is passively and actively
      controlled to operate at 200 +/- 0.5 K with a maximum drift of
      +/- 0.1 K/day.  A thermal radiator mounted on the
      interferometer cools the instrument by radiating to deep space.
      Three sets of proportionally controlled heaters provide fine
      thermal control for the primary telescope mirror, secondary
      mirror, and the interferometer.  It is necessary to maintain
      temperature differences between the three components to less
      than 0.1 K.  In addition, high-powered &apos;flash-off&apos; heaters are
      available for increasing the instrument temperature by
      approximately 70 K.  These are controlled by command.  These
      have been used to warm the instrument during cruise periods to
      reverse a gradual change in the elastic properties of a
      silicone compound in the Michelson motor dampers and
      beam-splitter mounts.
 
 
    Science Objectives
    ==================
      The scientific objectives of the Voyager Infrared
      Interferometer Spectrometer (IRIS) investigation include the
      following:
 
     (1)  Identification and determination of the abundances of
          gaseous atmospheric constituents;
     (2)  Determination of the helium abundance of the
          atmospheres of the giant planets;
     (3)  Determination of the energy balances of the giant
          planets through measurements of their total thermal
          emissions and Bond albedos;
     (4)  Determination of the three dimensional thermal
          structure of the atmospheres of the giant planets and
          Titan;
     (5)  Inference of information on atmospheric dynamics;
     (6)  Inference of the infrared optical properties of
          clouds and hazes;
     (7)  Determination of the temperature, composition, and
          structure of the surfaces of satellites without
          atmospheres;
     (8)  Determination of the thermal characteristics of
          Saturn&apos;s rings.
 
 
      These objectives are accomplished through the analysis of
      measurements of thermal emission spectra and broad band
      reflected solar energy.
 
 
    Operational Considerations
    ==========================
      The IRIS instruments on Voyager 1 and 2 operated normally
      throughout the mission.  The infrared interferometers of both
      instruments experienced a temporal decrease in responsivity,
      believed to be due to a gradual stiffening in silicon compounds
      used in the mirror mounts and motor dampers.  However, this was
      partially reversed by using the flash off heaters to raise the
      temperature of the instrument periodically during cruise
      between encounters.
 
 
    Calibration Description
    =======================
      In-flight calibration of the data from the interferometer is
      accomplished using periodic observations of deep space along
      with a precise knowledge of the instrument cavity temperature.
      Use of the instrument temperature itself as a calibration point
      was necessitated because the large size of the telescope made
      the use of an on-board blackbody target impractical.
 
      The calibration is carried out for each wavenumber interval
      independently using I = B*(Tinst)*(C2 C1)/C2 where I is the
      calibrated planetary radiance, B*(Tinst) is the Planck radiance
      at the instrument temperature Tinst, and C2 and C1 are the
      spectral amplitudes measured while observing the planet and
      deep space, respectively.  This calibration technique requires
      that the interferometer and all elements within its field of
      view, including the telescope mirrors, apertures, and baffles,
      be at precisely the same temperature.  This condition is
      insured through the use of thermostatically controlled heaters.
      To minimize systematic errors from possible small changes in
      the instrument responsivity, the calibration must be updated as
      a function of time during the encounter.
 
      During an encounter, the deep space spectra for each day were
      averaged and a time corresponding to the average time was
      assigned to each average.  In addition to the daily averages, a
      grand average of all deep space spectra was calculated.  For
      each day a ratio spectrum consisting of the daily average power
      spectrum divided by the grand average power spectrum was used
      to scale the grand average instrument response to obtain the
      daily response.  Individual spectra were then calibrated using
      a linear interpolation.  The calibrated spectral radiances are
      expressed in Watt/cm**2/sr/cm**-1.
 
      Radiometer calibration consists of a verification of instrument
      stability by repeated determinations of t(target plate), based
      on observations of a diffusely scattering target plate mounted
      on the spacecraft.  The calibration conversion to Watts at the
      detector takes into account the detector response and
      electrical gains.  Observations of the target plate were
      carried out before and after each encounter with the exception
      of after the Voyager 2 Saturn encounter when jamming of the
      instrument scan platform caused the maneuver to be aborted.
 
      The long term behavior of the target calibration data for the
      two IRIS radiometers is presented in the following tables.  The
      observed target signal, corrected for offsets, and normalized
      for changes in heliocentric distance, has remained constant
      within quantization uncertainties throughout the mission.  In
      the absence of compensating changes in the target plate and the
      instrument, this implies excellent radiometer stability.  The
      arithmetic average of all target measurements, with a 1.5%
      uncertainty, is adopted as the normalized target signal for
      purposes of absolute calibration: 30960 +/- 460 DNi x AU**2;
      this differs slightly from the published value 31152 +/- 312
      DNi x AU**2 [PEARL&amp;CONRATH1991].  The target signals for the
      integrating, x8 sampling, and x1 sampling radiometer data are
      in the ratio 24:8:1.

    Notes:
    [1] Where the difference between pre-encounter and
        post-encounter measurements of space exceeds the random
        baseline variation, the average is taken as the
        arithmetic mean, with the difference as the uncertainty.
    [2] Considers the larger of 0.5% (estimated maximum possible
        nonlinearity) or the baseline variation as the
        uncertainty.
    [3] All uncertainties are considered uncorrelated in
        calculation of the adjusted target signal.
    [4] For Voyager 2 only, the adopted mean value of 30960 +/-
        460 is entered for all cases in the calibration files.
    [5] For Voyager 2 Saturn post-encounter, the instrument
        platform jammed so the calibration maneuver was aborted.
 
 
      Because the spectral transmission of the radiometer is not flat
      across the bandwidth, further calibration requires knowledge of
      the relative spectrum of each object observed.  The absolute
      reflectance of the Voyager 1 and 2 target plates are 0.502 +/-
      0.018 and 0.497 +/- 0.018, respectively.  A detailed
      description of a technique for calibrating the radiometer is
      given in [HANELETAL1981A].
 
 
    Instrument Detectors
    ====================
      The detector of the broadband reflected solar radiometer is an
      eighteen-junction thermopile with a 3 second thermal time
      constant and is operated at a temperature of 200 K.  The
      thermopile used with the broadband radiometer has a noise
      equivalent power of 4E-10 Watt/Hz**1/2.
 
      The detector of the infrared interferometer is a low-impedance
      Schwartz-type four-junction thermopile with a thermal time
      constant of 12 millisecond.  and is operated at a temperature
      of 200 K.  The thermopile used with the interferometer has a
      noise equivalent power of approximately 2E-10 Watt/Hz**1/2.
 
 
    Instrument Electronics
    ======================
      The bulk of the analog and all of the digital circuitry is
      located in an electronics module separate form the
      interferometer module.  The power supply is located in still
      another box.  Only elements that had to be close to detectors
      to minimize noise, such as the sensors for temperature
      measurements and controls, were located in the optics module.
      The electronics box contains timing and control elements,
      mirror drive circuitry, housekeeping monitors, thermal
      controllers, analog-to-digital converters, and spacecraft
      interface circuits.  The power module contains one primary and
      two auxiliary power supplies that convert spacecraft primary ac
      into dc voltages required to operate the instrument.  One of
      the auxiliary supplies is always on to maintain the instrument
      at the proper temperature.  The primary power supply is on only
      when the instrument is on during tests, calibrations and
      observation periods during planetary encounters.  Because of
      the requirement to pass through the Jovian radiation
      environment, hardened electronics components were used where
      possible.  The bulk of the instrument electronics consists of
      radiation-hardened integrated circuits.  A description of the
      electronics, along with a block diagram, is given in
      [HANELETAL1980A].
 
 
    Instrument Optics
    =================
      The Cassegrain telescope has a parabolic primary mirror 50 cm
      in diameter with a 7.62 cm hyperbolic secondary mirror, and an
      effective focal length of 303.5 cm and an F number of 6.07.  A
      dichroic mirror divides the beam from the telescope into two
      separate beams, one going to the infrared interferometer and
      the other to the broadband reflected solar radiometer.  The
      telescope mirrors and support structure, like most of the other
      mechanical parts of the instrument, are made of optical-grade
      beryllium.  The primary mirror is gold coated over a nickel
      plating.  The secondary mirror has an aluminum coating over the
      nickel plating, and this in turn is overcoated with silicon
      monoxide for protection.
 
 
    Instrument Offset
    =================
      The instrument and the associated electronics and power supply
      modules are bolted to the scan platform.  The telescope is
      approximately bore-sighted with the wide and narrow angle
      television cameras, and with the PPS and UVS instruments.
 
 
    Instrument Parameters
    =====================
      The following instrument parameters are measured.
 
      Sampled Visible Radiance - Series of 8 radiometer samples taken
      during a 48 second data frame with the high gain channel.  The
      quantity given is power at the detector in Watts.  (-1.0
      indicates data off the planet).
 
      Integrated Visable Radiance - The broadband, reflected solar
      radiometer signal integrated over the 45.6 seconds that IRIS
      data are taken within the 48 second data frame.  The quantity
      given is power at the detector in Watts.
 
      Thermal Radiance - Radiance (W cm-2 ster-1) within a 4.3 cm-1
      spectral interval.
 
 
    Instrument Modes
    ================
      The instrument possesses only one operating mode.  When turned
      on the instruments acquires one interferogram every 48 second
      data frame.  In addition data from the reflected solar
      radiometer are also obtained every data frame.  The latter
      consist of a measurement integrated over 45.6 seconds as well
      as 8 samples of both high and normal gain measurements
      distributed at 6 second intervals throughout the data frame.

      Instrument Id                  : IRIS
      Instrument Host Id             : VG2

                                        SPECTROMETER AND RADIOMETER
      Instrument Type                : INFRARED INTERFEROMETER
 
 
    Instrument Description
    ======================
      The Voyager IRIS instrument consists of a Michelson
      interferometer for measurements in the thermal infrared and a
      single channel radiometer that operates in the visible and near
      infrared.  The two components of the instrument share a 50 cm
      Cassegrain telescope with an effective focal length of 303.5
      cm.  The angular field of view is 0.25 degree.  Light passing
      through the telescope is divided into two beams by a dichroic
      mirror, with that longer than about 2.5 micrometers going to
      the infrared interferometer and radiation between 0.33 and 2
      micrometers going to the radiometer.  The effective spectral
      range of the interferometer is 180-2500 cm**-1 (4-55
      micrometers) and the apodized spectral resolution is 4.3
      cm**-1.  The beam splitter of the interferometer consists of a
      multilayer dielectric coating applied to a cesium iodide
      substrate.  The moving mirror is mounted on one end of a motor
      shaft; the moving mirror of an auxiliary reference
      interferometer is attached to the other end of the shaft.  A
      0.5852 micrometer neon line source is used for the reference
      interferometer; the signal from this unit is used by a phase
      comparator and digital sampling circuit to control the motor
      speed and to quantize the analog signal from the main IR
      detector.  The latter is a low impedance, Schwartz-type
      thermopile with a noise equivalent power (NEP) of about 2E-10
      Watt/Hz**1/2.
 
      The spectral response of the radiometer, which is designed to
      measure the broadband reflected solar radiation, is controlled
      by the dichroic mirror and an additional coating on the
      radiometer side of the mirror.  The radiometer detector is an
      eighteen-junction thermopile with an NEP of 4E-10 Watt/Hz**1/2.
      A sapphire window is placed in front of the detector to reject
      unwanted long-wave radiation that may result from temperature
      gradients within the instrument.  The signal from the
      radiometer detector is fed to a low noise, low-drift dc
      amplifier with a time constant of approximately 2.7 seconds,
      and then to three different output circuits.  The first circuit
      integrates the radiometer signal over the 45.6 seconds it takes
      to record an interferogram, thus providing the average of the
      reflected sunlight during the time the infrared spectrum is
      recorded.  The second and third circuits provide the analog
      signal from the radiometer as well as the signal amplified by a
      factor of 8.  These latter channels are sampled every 6 seconds
      and digitized.  The timing of the samples, and their
      relationship to events in a single-frame read out of an image
      are given in Table 1.

      In order to visualize the effects of quantization uncertainties
      directly, it is sometimes useful to convert the radiometer
      watts at the detector back into data numbers (DN).  The
      relationships are:
 
            For Voyager 1:
 
               Sampled data (normal gain):
                  DNn = (WADn * 1e+08 - 2.51937) / 3.39426
               Sampled data (high gain):
                  DNh = (WADh * 1e+09 - 1.55472) / 4.26206
               Integrated data:
                  DNi = WADi / 1.42145 * 1e+09
 
            For Voyager 2:
 
               Sampled data (normal gain):
                  DNn = (WADn * 1e+08 - 6.33020) / 3.40070
               Sampled data (high gain):
                  DNh = (WADh * 1e+09 + 6.57589) / 4.24459
               Integrated data:
                  DNi = WADi / 1.42047 * 1e+09
 
 
      Pairs of baseline levels are averaged at the beginning and at
      the end of the 45.6 second integrations, occasionally resulting
      in half-integral DN values for the integrated radiometer data.
 
      Despite the stability of the calibration data (see below), a
      small systematic error may remain.  Comparison of spatially
      resolved IRIS observations of Jupiter and Saturn shows that
      reflectivities derived from Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 IRIS
      instruments are in the ratio 0.883:1.  An investigation was
      made of albedos of various objects (Jupiter, Io, Ganymede,
      Callisto, and Saturn), as determined using the two instruments.
      When compared to groundbased determinations, no systematic
      differences were apparent for either instrument, within the
      uncertainties.  Thus, a systematic error on the order of 10%
      may exist in the calibration of one or both of the IRIS
      instruments&apos; radiometer systems.
 
      The temperature of the instrument is passively and actively
      controlled to operate at 200 +/- 0.5 K with a maximum drift of
      +/- 0.1 K/day.  A thermal radiator mounted on the
      interferometer cools the instrument by radiating to deep space.
      Three sets of proportionally controlled heaters provide fine
      thermal control for the primary telescope mirror, secondary
      mirror, and the interferometer.  It is necessary to maintain
      temperature differences between the three components to less
      than 0.1 K.  In addition, high-powered &apos;flash-off&apos; heaters are
      available for increasing the instrument temperature by
      approximately 70 K.  These are controlled by command.  These
      have been used to warm the instrument during cruise periods to
      reverse a gradual change in the elastic properties of a
      silicone compound in the Michelson motor dampers and
      beam-splitter mounts.
 
 
    Science Objectives
    ==================
      The scientific objectives of the Voyager Infrared
      Interferometer Spectrometer (IRIS) investigation include the
      following:
 
     (1)  Identification and determination of the abundances of
          gaseous atmospheric constituents;
     (2)  Determination of the helium abundance of the
          atmospheres of the giant planets;
     (3)  Determination of the energy balances of the giant
          planets through measurements of their total thermal
          emissions and Bond albedos;
     (4)  Determination of the three dimensional thermal
          structure of the atmospheres of the giant planets and
          Titan;
     (5)  Inference of information on atmospheric dynamics;
     (6)  Inference of the infrared optical properties of
          clouds and hazes;
     (7)  Determination of the temperature, composition, and
          structure of the surfaces of satellites without
          atmospheres;
     (8)  Determination of the thermal characteristics of
          Saturn&apos;s rings.
 
 
      These objectives are accomplished through the analysis of
      measurements of thermal emission spectra and broad band
      reflected solar energy.
 
 
    Operational Considerations
    ==========================
      The IRIS instruments on Voyager 1 and 2 operated normally
      throughout the mission.  The infrared interferometers of both
      instruments experienced a temporal decrease in responsivity,
      believed to be due to a gradual stiffening in silicon compounds
      used in the mirror mounts and motor dampers.  However, this was
      partially reversed by using the flash off heaters to raise the
      temperature of the instrument periodically during cruise
      between encounters.
 
 
    Calibration Description
    =======================
      In-flight calibration of the data from the interferometer is
      accomplished using periodic observations of deep space along
      with a precise knowledge of the instrument cavity temperature.
      Use of the instrument temperature itself as a calibration point
      was necessitated because the large size of the telescope made
      the use of an on-board blackbody target impractical.
 
      The calibration is carried out for each wavenumber interval
      independently using I = B*(Tinst)*(C2 C1)/C2 where I is the
      calibrated planetary radiance, B*(Tinst) is the Planck radiance
      at the instrument temperature Tinst, and C2 and C1 are the
      spectral amplitudes measured while observing the planet and
      deep space, respectively.  This calibration technique requires
      that the interferometer and all elements within its field of
      view, including the telescope mirrors, apertures, and baffles,
      be at precisely the same temperature.  This condition is
      insured through the use of thermostatically controlled heaters.
      To minimize systematic errors from possible small changes in
      the instrument responsivity, the calibration must be updated as
      a function of time during the encounter.
 
      During an encounter, the deep space spectra for each day were
      averaged and a time corresponding to the average time was
      assigned to each average.  In addition to the daily averages, a
      grand average of all deep space spectra was calculated.  For
      each day a ratio spectrum consisting of the daily average power
      spectrum divided by the grand average power spectrum was used
      to scale the grand average instrument response to obtain the
      daily response.  Individual spectra were then calibrated using
      a linear interpolation.  The calibrated spectral radiances are
      expressed in Watt/cm**2/sr/cm**-1.
 
      Radiometer calibration consists of a verification of instrument
      stability by repeated determinations of t(target plate), based
      on observations of a diffusely scattering target plate mounted
      on the spacecraft.  The calibration conversion to Watts at the
      detector takes into account the detector response and
      electrical gains.  Observations of the target plate were
      carried out before and after each encounter with the exception
      of after the Voyager 2 Saturn encounter when jamming of the
      instrument scan platform caused the maneuver to be aborted.
 
      The long term behavior of the target calibration data for the
      two IRIS radiometers is presented in the following tables.  The
      observed target signal, corrected for offsets, and normalized
      for changes in heliocentric distance, has remained constant
      within quantization uncertainties throughout the mission.  In
      the absence of compensating changes in the target plate and the
      instrument, this implies excellent radiometer stability.  The
      arithmetic average of all target measurements, with a 1.5%
      uncertainty, is adopted as the normalized target signal for
      purposes of absolute calibration: 30960 +/- 460 DNi x AU**2;
      this differs slightly from the published value 31152 +/- 312
      DNi x AU**2 [PEARL&amp;CONRATH1991].  The target signals for the
      integrating, x8 sampling, and x1 sampling radiometer data are
      in the ratio 24:8:1.

    Notes:
    [1] Where the difference between pre-encounter and
        post-encounter measurements of space exceeds the random
        baseline variation, the average is taken as the
        arithmetic mean, with the difference as the uncertainty.
    [2] Considers the larger of 0.5% (estimated maximum possible
        nonlinearity) or the baseline variation as the
        uncertainty.
    [3] All uncertainties are considered uncorrelated in
        calculation of the adjusted target signal.
    [4] For Voyager 2 only, the adopted mean value of 30960 +/-
        460 is entered for all cases in the calibration files.
    [5] For Voyager 2 Saturn post-encounter, the instrument
        platform jammed so the calibration maneuver was aborted.
 
 
      Because the spectral transmission of the radiometer is not flat
      across the bandwidth, further calibration requires knowledge of
      the relative spectrum of each object observed.  The absolute
      reflectance of the Voyager 1 and 2 target plates are 0.502 +/-
      0.018 and 0.497 +/- 0.018, respectively.  A detailed
      description of a technique for calibrating the radiometer is
      given in [HANELETAL1981A].
 
 
    Instrument Detectors
    ====================
      The detector of the broadband reflected solar radiometer is an
      eighteen-junction thermopile with a 3 second thermal time
      constant and is operated at a temperature of 200 K.  The
      thermopile used with the broadband radiometer has a noise
      equivalent power of 4E-10 Watt/Hz**1/2.
 
      The detector of the infrared interferometer is a low-impedance
      Schwartz-type four-junction thermopile with a thermal time
      constant of 12 millisecond.  and is operated at a temperature
      of 200 K.  The thermopile used with the interferometer has a
      noise equivalent power of approximately 2E-10 Watt/Hz**1/2.
 
 
    Instrument Electronics
    ======================
      The bulk of the analog and all of the digital circuitry is
      located in an electronics module separate form the
      interferometer module.  The power supply is located in still
      another box.  Only elements that had to be close to detectors
      to minimize noise, such as the sensors for temperature
      measurements and controls, were located in the optics module.
      The electronics box contains timing and control elements,
      mirror drive circuitry, housekeeping monitors, thermal
      controllers, analog-to-digital converters, and spacecraft
      interface circuits.  The power module contains one primary and
      two auxiliary power supplies that convert spacecraft primary ac
      into dc voltages required to operate the instrument.  One of
      the auxiliary supplies is always on to maintain the instrument
      at the proper temperature.  The primary power supply is on only
      when the instrument is on during tests, calibrations and
      observation periods during planetary encounters.  Because of
      the requirement to pass through the Jovian radiation
      environment, hardened electronics components were used where
      possible.  The bulk of the instrument electronics consists of
      radiation-hardened integrated circuits.  A description of the
      electronics, along with a block diagram, is given in
      [HANELETAL1980A].
 
 
    Instrument Optics
    =================
      The Cassegrain telescope has a parabolic primary mirror 50 cm
      in diameter with a 7.62 cm hyperbolic secondary mirror, and an
      effective focal length of 303.5 cm and an F number of 6.07.  A
      dichroic mirror divides the beam from the telescope into two
      separate beams, one going to the infrared interferometer and
      the other to the broadband reflected solar radiometer.  The
      telescope mirrors and support structure, like most of the other
      mechanical parts of the instrument, are made of optical-grade
      beryllium.  The primary mirror is gold coated over a nickel
      plating.  The secondary mirror has an aluminum coating over the
      nickel plating, and this in turn is overcoated with silicon
      monoxide for protection.
 
 
    Instrument Offset
    =================
      The instrument and the associated electronics and power supply
      modules are bolted to the scan platform.  The telescope is
      approximately bore-sighted with the wide and narrow angle
      television cameras, and with the PPS and UVS instruments.
 
 
    Instrument Parameters
    =====================
      The following instrument parameters are measured.
 
      Sampled Visible Radiance - Series of 8 radiometer samples taken
      during a 48 second data frame with the high gain channel.  The
      quantity given is power at the detector in Watts.  (-1.0
      indicates data off the planet).
 
      Integrated Visable Radiance - The broadband, reflected solar
      radiometer signal integrated over the 45.6 seconds that IRIS
      data are taken within the 48 second data frame.  The quantity
      given is power at the detector in Watts.
 
      Thermal Radiance - Radiance (W cm-2 ster-1) within a 4.3 cm-1
      spectral interval.
 
 
    Instrument Modes
    ================
      The instrument possesses only one operating mode.  When turned
      on the instruments acquires one interferogram every 48 second
      data frame.  In addition data from the reflected solar
      radiometer are also obtained every data frame.  The latter
      consist of a measurement integrated over 45.6 seconds as well
      as 8 samples of both high and normal gain measurements
      distributed at 6 second intervals throughout the data frame.

    Instrument Description
    ======================
      The Voyager 1 and 2 Ultraviolet Spectrometers are nearly
      identical instruments.  This discussion applies to both, except
      in a few instances in which important differences between the
      two are noted explicitly.  The Voyager 1 Ultraviolet
      Spectrometer (UVS) is a compact Wadsworth mounted objective
      grating spectrometer that covers the wavelength range of 0.0535
      to 0.1702 micron (0.0513 to 0.1680 micron for the Voyager 2
      UVS).  It records the entire spectrum within this range in a
      single exposure.  It has no moving parts.  A mechanical
      &apos;collimator&apos; consisting of a series of 13 aperture plates
      defines the main &apos;airglow&apos; field of view (FOV) of 0.10 degrees
      degrees full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) x 0.87 degrees in length.
      Light passing through the collimator strikes the concave
      diffraction grating at near normal incidence.  The grating
      disperses and focuses light onto a 1-d array detector that
      records individual photoevents.  An auxiliary field of view for
      solar occultation experiments is offset 20 degrees from the
      airglow field by a small mirror near the front of the
      collimator. Using this &apos;occultation port&apos;, the UVS can view the
      Sun without pointing the main field, and those of other
      coaligned instruments, directly at the Sun.  The occultation
      field is 0.25 FWHM x 0.87 degrees.  A sunshade prevents
      illumination of the main entrance aperture by the sun during
      occultation observations.
 
      The UVS has two spectral resolutions depending on the nature of
      the source.  An extended monochromatic source that fills the
      FOV ideally produces a triangular intensity distribution of 0.1
      degree FWHM.  (The actual response function is slightly rounded
      at the top and base, but a triangle is a satisfactory
      approximation for most applications.) The 0.1 degree
      corresponds to width of 3.5 anodes, or 0.0033 microns.  This
      inherent spectral resolution may often be improved by spectral
      analysis.  A monochromatic point source is imaged onto a width
      of about 1 anode for a practical resolution of about 0.0015
      microns.  Precise measurements of the relative response as a
      function of position within the FOV have been made by rastering
      the FOV across a star.  At wavelengths longward of 0.1350
      microns there is a slight (~10%) asymmetry in the response on
      either side of the center of the FOV.
 
      The effective sizes of the entrance apertures are (airglow
      port) 21.2 and (occultation port) 0.75 cm**2.
 
      The anode array is scanned at a rate of 3125 scans per second
      and the results are added into an internal memory.  The UVS
      transmits the contents of this memory to the flight data system
      (FDS) on command of the FDS.  The FDS retrieves values for a
      pair of channels each 5 msec, and so reads a complete spectrum
      from the UVS in 0.32 sec.  For the fastest transmitted data
      rate (OC-1, see below) used for occultation observations, this
      readout proceeds continuously, producing a series of spectra
      separated by 0.32 sec.  For lower data rates, the memory is
      read in bursts of 0.32 sec separated by the appropriate
      intervals.  During these intervals, the UVS integrates the
      spectrum in its internal memory.  As the data is transferred to
      the FDS it is logarithmically compressed from 16 to 10 bits.
 
      The FDS determines the rate at which spectra are read from the
      UVS after being integrated internally in the instrument memory.
      Most planetary observations are made at one of two data rates,
      OC-1 (0.32 sec spectra, for occultation measurements) and GS-3
      (3.84 sec spectra, for emission spectroscopy).  Slower rates
      are used from time to time.  Rates and their designations are:
 
          Name            Mode #           Integration time (sec)
            OC-1            1                0.32

            UV-5A           10               3.84
 
      A description of the UVS investigation is given by
      [BROADFOOTETAL1977].  Performance and analysis techniques are
      described by [BROADFOOTETAL1981].
 
 
    Scientific Objectives
    =====================
      The primary goal of the UVS is to study the composition and
      structure of the atmospheres of the outer planets and their
      satellites.  Secondary goals include the study of
      magnetospheric particle populations, magnetosphere-atmosphere
      interactions, the composition and distribution of the
      interplanetary wind, determinations of the solar flux, and
      stellar astronomy.
 
 
    Operational Considerations
    ==========================
      The Voyager UVS instruments have operated nearly continuously
      since launch in 1977.  With the singular exception of a
      decrease in the Voyager 1 microchannel plates (MCP) gain, due
      to a high radiation-induced count rate during passage through
      the inner Jovian magnetosphere, both instruments have remained
      photometrically stable at a better than 3% level since 1977.
      In-flight performance of the UVS from launch through the 1979
      Jupiter encounters is reviewed in [BROADFOOTETAL1981] and an up
      to date description of astronomical observations is contained
      in [HOLBERG1990] and [LINICK&amp;HOLBERG1991].
 
 
    Calibration Description
    =======================
      Laboratory calibration of the UVS included measurements of:
 
          1) sensitivity at a number of wavelengths throughout the
             spectral range,
          2) response to scattered light,
          3) off-axis response, including collimator transmission
             function, and
          4) intrinsic dark count rate.
 
      In-flight calibration has included assessments of absolute
      sensitivity by comparisons with stars, and measurements of the
      FOV response profile using stars.
 
      Before the absolute calibration can be applied to a measured
      spectrum, three or four spectral analysis steps are required.
      These are flat field correction, dark count subtraction, and
      descattering, and (sometimes) sky background removal.
 
      Channel-to-channel variations in sensitivity result from
      variations in effective count threshold among channels.
      Applying a &apos;fixed pattern noise&apos; (FPN) correction adjusts the
      signal levels to their equivalents for a common threshold in
      all channels.  The FPN correction involves a channel-by-channel
      multiplication by a correction spectrum.  The correction
      spectra are different for Voyager 1 and Voyager 2.  In fact,
      two spectra are in use for Voyager 1.  The first is used for
      data acquired before Jupiter encounter and the second for data
      after encounter.  The two differ to account for changes in the
      response of the Voyager 1 UVS induced by its operation in the
      intense Jovian radiation environment.
 
      Channels 3 and 4 have large FPN corrections, i.e.  they are
      less sensitive than the others.  Therefore the statistical
      accuracy of the signal in these channels is lower than in the
      other channels.
 
 
      Dark Counts
      -----------
        In interplanetary space, detector dark counts arise mainly
        from effects of gamma radiation from the radioisotope
        thermoelectric generators that power the spacecraft.  The
        count rate is about 0.02 counts per channel per second.  The
        shape is approximately flat in wavelength, with a step near
        the edge of the filter in the detector.  The shape is
        accurately known from long observations of the calibration
        plate mounted on the spacecraft.  Almost no photon signal
        (except for a weak reflection of sky-background H Lyman
        alpha) is recorded during these observations.  The absolute
        level varies slightly with scan platform position, because
        rotating the scan platform changes the shielding mass between
        the UVS detector and the generators.  For data acquired
        outside a planetary magnetosphere, subtracting a scaled dark
        spectrum from a calibration plate observation is usually a
        satisfactory correction for dark counting.
 
        Within a planetary magnetosphere, the dark count rate can
        include contributions from high-energy particles.  For lower
        levels, scaling a calibration plate spectrum is again
        satisfactory, but for higher levels the shape of the dark
        spectrum changes and another method must be used to
        estimate dark levels.  The best alternative is to use a
        spectrum taken at nearly the same time with no significant
        source in the FOV.  Satellite observations often fill this
        need.
 
 
      Descattering
      ------------
        Light scattered within the instrument illuminates channels
        outside the ideal transmission function of the collimator.
        The effects of scattering are removed by a process called
        descattering.  Descattering is accomplished through the use
        of a matrix operator, a 126x126 element matrix which
        describes the response of detector channel &apos;j&apos; to the
        measured signal at channel &apos;i&apos;.  This scattering matrix is
        completely empirical, having been determined from laboratory
        measurements of 50 individual emission lines covering the
        entire passband.  Descattering is a linear operation.  Dark
        counts must be subtracted prior to descattering as the
        descattering algorithm is based on the assumption that only
        photon events are present.  Descattering will also correct
        for second order response.  Therefore, if the spectrum to be
        descattered contains artifacts, such as anomalously high or
        low counts in channels 3 or 4, a corresponding error will be
        introduced in the vicinity of both the first and second order
        positions.
 
 
      Sky Background Subtraction
      --------------------------
        When the UVS slit is not completely filled by the disk of a
        planet, the portion off the planet sees the sky background.
        Fortunately, in the far UV the sky is generally quite dark
        and diffuse starlight is seldom significant.  However, bright
        emissions at H Lyman alpha, Lyman beta, and He 0.0584 microns
        from the interplanetary medium (IPM) often must be taken into
        account.  These lines arise from strong solar chromospheric
        emission lines that are scattered from neutral H and He of
        the local interstellar medium.  The physics of this
        &apos;interstellar wind&apos; is complex and leads to emission which is
        inhomogeneous in space and variable in time.  The IPM
        responds to active regions of the solar chromosphere as the
        sun rotates.  This means that the sky brightness as seen by
        the UVS can change noticeably on time scale of days.  As with
        instrumental dark counts, there are two standard means of
        removing sky background: direct subtraction of an adjacent
        sky background suitably scaled, if available, and
        construction of a synthetic sky background spectrum.
 
 
      Calibration
      -----------
        Calibrating the spectra converts them from count units to
        absolute brightness units. This step has not been included in
        the data processing because the correct procedure depends on
        the type of source viewed. The data spectra represent count
        rates after correction for fixed pattern noise, a background
        subtraction, and descattering. Multiplying these spectra by
        one of the calibration spectra converts it to brightness
        units. There is a calibration spectrum corresponding to each
        of the two source types, namely point sources and extended
        sources.
 
        Point Source: Multiplying a data spectrum by the calibration
        spectrum VxPTCAL.TAB (x=1 for Voyager 1 and x=2 for Voyager 2)
        converts the spectrum from counts/(channel) to
        photons/(cm**2-Angstrom-time), where time is the integration
        time of the spectrum.
 
        Extended Source, continuum emission: Multiplying a data
        spectrum that has been normalized to an integration time of 1
        second by the calibration spectrum VxFLCAL.TAB (x=1 for
        Voyager 1 and 2 for Voyager 2) converts the spectrum from
        counts/(channel-second) to spectral brightness in units of
        Rayleighs/Angstrom for a source that fills the field of view.
 
        Extended Source, monochromatic emission: The finite spectral
        resolution (about 35 A) of the spectrograph must be considered
        in this case. For isolated lines (those that are not strongly
        blended with emissions at nearby wavelengths) it is sufficient
        to sum the channels that include light from the emission of
        interest (about 7 channels) and multiply by the appropriate
        calibration factor. This factor is the product of the
        dispersion (9.26 Angstroms/channel) and the value in
        VxFLCAL.TAB corresponding to the center channel of the
        wavelength of interest. The resulting quantity is the
        brightness of a monochromatic emission that fills the field of
        view. For more complex spectra that include blended emissions,
        the most accurate approach is spectral analysis by generating
        synthetic spectra. This technique uses an iterative approach
        to adjust an estimated brightness spectrum until the model
        spectrum computed from it matches the observed spectrum. The
        model can be fairly simple, but must include the triangular
        transmission profile of the collimator and the instrument
        sensitivity (calibration). The calibration factor described
        earlier in this paragraph is the correct one to use for this
        kind of synthesis.
 
 
        Calibration and spectral analysis issues are discussed by
        [HOLBERGETAL1982] and [HOLBERG1986].
 
 
    Platform Mounting Descriptions
    ==============================
      The UVS is mounted on the scan platform.  The instrument is
      approximately bore-sighted with the wide and narrow angle
      television cameras, and with the PPS and IRIS instruments.  The
      alignment of the fields is not perfect; the following table
      gives offsets of the centers of the UVS fields relative to the
      centers of the ISS Narrow Angle Camera fields of view.
      Elevation is positive to the right within the imaging field of
      view, and cross-elevation is positive downward.  The narrow axis
      of the UVS slit is aligned with the elevation direction.

    Instrument Detector &apos;SPECTROMETER&apos;
    ==================================
      The windowless, photoevent-counting detector consists of an
      electron multiplier, a pair of microchannel plates (MCP) in
      series, and a 128-element linear self-scanned readout array.
      Photoelectrons ejected at the front of the MCP stack are
      amplified by a factor of about 1E6, and the resulting charge
      pulse is collected by the anode array.  The 128 narrow aluminum
      anodes, each 3 mm long, are deposited on 0.1-mm centers for a
      collecting length (in the dispersion direction) of 13 mm.
 
      The anodes are accessed sequentially by a shift register and
      FET switches contained on the single integrated circuit.  The
      scanning circuitry discharges each anode into a charge
      sensitive preamplifier.  The charge pulse is digitized and the
      information added into a shift register memory consisting of
      128 16-bit words.  The 128-anode array consists of two separate
      interdigitated 64-anode arrays scanned by two shift registers.
      The shift registers and memory are driven by a 200 kHz clock,
      so that an individual anode is accessed every 320 microsecond.
      The detector scan rate is therefore about 3125 Hz.
 
      Wavelengths shorter than about 0.1250 micron strike the MCP
      directly.  Longer wavelengths first pass through a MgF2 filter
      with a semi-transparent photocathode of CuI.  This serves to
      boost the quantum efficiency at long wavelengths and to reduce
      the response to second-order light.
 
      The detector is heavily shielded to reduce its response to
      trapped particle radiation.  A description of the detector may
      be found in [BROADFOOT&amp;SANDEL1977].

    Instrument Electronics &apos;UVS&apos;
    ============================
      The UVS electronics is housed in an enclosure integral with the
      optical section of instrument.  Most of the electronics is in
      the base of the instrument, but clock drive generators for the
      anode array and the first stage of charge sensitive
      preamplification of the analog signal processing electronics
      are mounted in the detector housing so that they are near the
      anode array.  Elements of the electronics complement include:
 
           (1)  Low voltage power supply
           (2)  High voltage power supply
           (3)  Clock drive generator for the anode array
           (4)  Analog signal processing electronics including A/D
                conversion
           (5)  128x16 bit accumulation memory for spectrum
           (6)  FDS interface
 
      The FDS interface sends data to the FDS on demand and accepts
      mode commands from the FDS.  The mode commands set the level of
      the high voltage applied to the MCPs of the detector and set
      the mode of analog signal processing (pulse counting or
      integration).
 
      Radiation-hard electronics components were used where possible,
      and spot radiation shielding was used to reduce the fluence at
      certain critical elements.
 
 
    Instrument Optics &apos;UVS&apos;
    =======================
      The optical system consists mainly of the mechanical collimator
      and concave diffraction grating.  The 13 aperture plates of the
      collimator establish a field of 0.1x0.87 degree for the airglow
      field and 0.25x0.87 degree for the occultation field.  The 0.1
      and 0.25 degree dimensions are in the dispersion direction, and
      the 0.87 degree dimension is in the cross-dispersion direction.
      The collimator provides separate light paths for the airglow
      and occultation ports, and a small mirror diverts the
      occultation field by 20 degrees from the airglow field.
 
      The concave diffraction grating is a platinum coated replica,
      ruled at 540 lines/mm, blazed at 0.0800 microns and having a
      spherical radius of curvature of 400.1 mm.  Dispersion in the
      image plane is 0.00926 microns/mm, or 0.000926 microns/channel.
      The grating substrate is a 4x6-cm rectangle, and the useful
      ruled area is 21 square cm.

    Instrument Mode &apos;PULSE COUNTING&apos;
    ================================
      Two modes of electrical operation allow the detector to operate
      in a photon-counting mode for low source intensities, or in an
      integration mode for high source intensities.  In the pulse
      counting mode, the number in the corresponding memory location
      is incremented by one if a charge above a fixed threshold is
      detected on an anode.  The access time of 320 microsec implies
      that single random photoevents can be recorded on any one of
      the anodes at a rate of about 300 Hz with a coincidence of 10%.
      The pulse-counting mode is used for all measurements except
      solar occultations.

    Instrument Mode &apos;PULSE INTEGRATION&apos;
    ===================================
      In the pulse integration mode a 3-bit A-to-D converter is
      introduced ahead of the adder.  In this case the charge on each
      anode is coarsely digitized and added to the previously
      accumulated signal in memory.  The statistics of sampling these
      events is complicated by the logarithmic pulse height
      distribution of the events.  There is also a logarithmic
      current limit function of the MCPs at the high event rates that
      normally obtain when this mode is used.  Because both these
      characteristics lead to non-linear response, modeling of the
      detector response is needed to restore linearity.  The
      integration mode is used for observing solar occultations.

    Instrument Description
    ======================
      The Voyager 1 and 2 Ultraviolet Spectrometers are nearly
      identical instruments.  This discussion applies to both, except
      in a few instances in which important differences between the
      two are noted explicitly.  The Voyager 1 Ultraviolet
      Spectrometer (UVS) is a compact Wadsworth mounted objective
      grating spectrometer that covers the wavelength range of 0.0535
      to 0.1702 micron (0.0513 to 0.1680 micron for the Voyager 2
      UVS).  It records the entire spectrum within this range in a
      single exposure.  It has no moving parts.  A mechanical
      &apos;collimator&apos; consisting of a series of 13 aperture plates
      defines the main &apos;airglow&apos; field of view (FOV) of 0.10 degrees
      degrees full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) x 0.87 degrees in length.
      Light passing through the collimator strikes the concave
      diffraction grating at near normal incidence.  The grating
      disperses and focuses light onto a 1-d array detector that
      records individual photoevents.  An auxiliary field of view for
      solar occultation experiments is offset 20 degrees from the
      airglow field by a small mirror near the front of the
      collimator. Using this &apos;occultation port&apos;, the UVS can view the
      Sun without pointing the main field, and those of other
      coaligned instruments, directly at the Sun.  The occultation
      field is 0.25 FWHM x 0.87 degrees.  A sunshade prevents
      illumination of the main entrance aperture by the sun during
      occultation observations.
 
      The UVS has two spectral resolutions depending on the nature of
      the source.  An extended monochromatic source that fills the
      FOV ideally produces a triangular intensity distribution of 0.1
      degree FWHM.  (The actual response function is slightly rounded
      at the top and base, but a triangle is a satisfactory
      approximation for most applications.) The 0.1 degree
      corresponds to width of 3.5 anodes, or 0.0033 microns.  This
      inherent spectral resolution may often be improved by spectral
      analysis.  A monochromatic point source is imaged onto a width
      of about 1 anode for a practical resolution of about 0.0015
      microns.  Precise measurements of the relative response as a
      function of position within the FOV have been made by rastering
      the FOV across a star.  At wavelengths longward of 0.1350
      microns there is a slight (~10%) asymmetry in the response on
      either side of the center of the FOV.
 
      The effective sizes of the entrance apertures are (airglow
      port) 21.2 and (occultation port) 0.75 cm**2.
 
      The anode array is scanned at a rate of 3125 scans per second
      and the results are added into an internal memory.  The UVS
      transmits the contents of this memory to the flight data system
      (FDS) on command of the FDS.  The FDS retrieves values for a
      pair of channels each 5 msec, and so reads a complete spectrum
      from the UVS in 0.32 sec.  For the fastest transmitted data
      rate (OC-1, see below) used for occultation observations, this
      readout proceeds continuously, producing a series of spectra
      separated by 0.32 sec.  For lower data rates, the memory is
      read in bursts of 0.32 sec separated by the appropriate
      intervals.  During these intervals, the UVS integrates the
      spectrum in its internal memory.  As the data is transferred to
      the FDS it is logarithmically compressed from 16 to 10 bits.
 
      The FDS determines the rate at which spectra are read from the
      UVS after being integrated internally in the instrument memory.
      Most planetary observations are made at one of two data rates,
      OC-1 (0.32 sec spectra, for occultation measurements) and GS-3
      (3.84 sec spectra, for emission spectroscopy).  Slower rates
      are used from time to time.  Rates and their designations are:
 
          Name            Mode #           Integration time (sec)
            OC-1            1                0.32
            GS-3            2                3.84
            CR-1            3                12

      A description of the UVS investigation is given by
      [BROADFOOTETAL1977].  Performance and analysis techniques are
      described by [BROADFOOTETAL1981].
 
 
    Scientific Objectives
    =====================
      The primary goal of the UVS is to study the composition and
      structure of the atmospheres of the outer planets and their
      satellites.  Secondary goals include the study of
      magnetospheric particle populations, magnetosphere-atmosphere
      interactions, the composition and distribution of the
      interplanetary wind, determinations of the solar flux, and
      stellar astronomy.
 
 
    Operational Considerations
    ==========================
      The Voyager UVS instruments have operated nearly continuously
      since launch in 1977.  With the singular exception of a
      decrease in the Voyager 1 microchannel plates (MCP) gain, due
      to a high radiation-induced count rate during passage through
      the inner Jovian magnetosphere, both instruments have remained
      photometrically stable at a better than 3% level since 1977.
      In-flight performance of the UVS from launch through the 1979
      Jupiter encounters is reviewed in [BROADFOOTETAL1981] and an up
      to date description of astronomical observations is contained
      in [HOLBERG1990] and [LINICK&amp;HOLBERG1991].
 
 
    Calibration Description
    =======================
      Laboratory calibration of the UVS included measurements of:
 
          1) sensitivity at a number of wavelengths throughout the
             spectral range,
          2) response to scattered light,
          3) off-axis response, including collimator transmission
             function, and
          4) intrinsic dark count rate.
 
      In-flight calibration has included assessments of absolute
      sensitivity by comparisons with stars, and measurements of the
      FOV response profile using stars.
 
      Before the absolute calibration can be applied to a measured
      spectrum, three or four spectral analysis steps are required.
      These are flat field correction, dark count subtraction, and
      descattering, and (sometimes) sky background removal.
 
      Channel-to-channel variations in sensitivity result from
      variations in effective count threshold among channels.
      Applying a &apos;fixed pattern noise&apos; (FPN) correction adjusts the
      signal levels to their equivalents for a common threshold in
      all channels.  The FPN correction involves a channel-by-channel
      multiplication by a correction spectrum.  The correction
      spectra are different for Voyager 1 and Voyager 2.  In fact,
      two spectra are in use for Voyager 1.  The first is used for
      data acquired before Jupiter encounter and the second for data
      after encounter.  The two differ to account for changes in the
      response of the Voyager 1 UVS induced by its operation in the
      intense Jovian radiation environment.
 
      Channels 3 and 4 have large FPN corrections, i.e.  they are
      less sensitive than the others.  Therefore the statistical
      accuracy of the signal in these channels is lower than in the
      other channels.
 
 
      Dark Counts
      -----------
        In interplanetary space, detector dark counts arise mainly
        from effects of gamma radiation from the radioisotope
        thermoelectric generators that power the spacecraft.  The
        count rate is about 0.02 counts per channel per second.  The
        shape is approximately flat in wavelength, with a step near
        the edge of the filter in the detector.  The shape is
        accurately known from long observations of the calibration
        plate mounted on the spacecraft.  Almost no photon signal
        (except for a weak reflection of sky-background H Lyman
        alpha) is recorded during these observations.  The absolute
        level varies slightly with scan platform position, because
        rotating the scan platform changes the shielding mass between
        the UVS detector and the generators.  For data acquired
        outside a planetary magnetosphere, subtracting a scaled dark
        spectrum from a calibration plate observation is usually a
        satisfactory correction for dark counting.
 
        Within a planetary magnetosphere, the dark count rate can
        include contributions from high-energy particles.  For lower
        levels, scaling a calibration plate spectrum is again
        satisfactory, but for higher levels the shape of the dark
        spectrum changes and another method must be used to
        estimate dark levels.  The best alternative is to use a
        spectrum taken at nearly the same time with no significant
        source in the FOV.  Satellite observations often fill this
        need.
 
 
      Descattering
      ------------
        Light scattered within the instrument illuminates channels
        outside the ideal transmission function of the collimator.
        The effects of scattering are removed by a process called
        descattering.  Descattering is accomplished through the use
        of a matrix operator, a 126x126 element matrix which
        describes the response of detector channel &apos;j&apos; to the
        measured signal at channel &apos;i&apos;.  This scattering matrix is
        completely empirical, having been determined from laboratory
        measurements of 50 individual emission lines covering the
        entire passband.  Descattering is a linear operation.  Dark
        counts must be subtracted prior to descattering as the
        descattering algorithm is based on the assumption that only
        photon events are present.  Descattering will also correct
        for second order response.  Therefore, if the spectrum to be
        descattered contains artifacts, such as anomalously high or
        low counts in channels 3 or 4, a corresponding error will be
        introduced in the vicinity of both the first and second order
        positions.
 
 
      Sky Background Subtraction
      --------------------------
        When the UVS slit is not completely filled by the disk of a
        planet, the portion off the planet sees the sky background.
        Fortunately, in the far UV the sky is generally quite dark
        and diffuse starlight is seldom significant.  However, bright
        emissions at H Lyman alpha, Lyman beta, and He 0.0584 microns
        from the interplanetary medium (IPM) often must be taken into
        account.  These lines arise from strong solar chromospheric
        emission lines that are scattered from neutral H and He of
        the local interstellar medium.  The physics of this
        &apos;interstellar wind&apos; is complex and leads to emission which is
        inhomogeneous in space and variable in time.  The IPM
        responds to active regions of the solar chromosphere as the
        sun rotates.  This means that the sky brightness as seen by
        the UVS can change noticeably on time scale of days.  As with
        instrumental dark counts, there are two standard means of
        removing sky background: direct subtraction of an adjacent
        sky background suitably scaled, if available, and
        construction of a synthetic sky background spectrum.
 
 
      Calibration
      -----------
        Calibrating the spectra converts them from count units to
        absolute brightness units. This step has not been included in
        the data processing because the correct procedure depends on
        the type of source viewed. The data spectra represent count
        rates after correction for fixed pattern noise, a background
        subtraction, and descattering. Multiplying these spectra by
        one of the calibration spectra converts it to brightness
        units. There is a calibration spectrum corresponding to each
        of the two source types, namely point sources and extended
        sources.
 
        Point Source: Multiplying a data spectrum by the calibration
        spectrum VxPTCAL.TAB (x=1 for Voyager 1 and x=2 for Voyager 2)
        converts the spectrum from counts/(channel) to
        photons/(cm**2-Angstrom-time), where time is the integration
        time of the spectrum.
 
        Extended Source, continuum emission: Multiplying a data
        spectrum that has been normalized to an integration time of 1
        second by the calibration spectrum VxFLCAL.TAB (x=1 for
        Voyager 1 and 2 for Voyager 2) converts the spectrum from
        counts/(channel-second) to spectral brightness in units of
        Rayleighs/Angstrom for a source that fills the field of view.
 
        Extended Source, monochromatic emission: The finite spectral
        resolution (about 35 A) of the spectrograph must be considered
        in this case. For isolated lines (those that are not strongly
        blended with emissions at nearby wavelengths) it is sufficient
        to sum the channels that include light from the emission of
        interest (about 7 channels) and multiply by the appropriate
        calibration factor. This factor is the product of the
        dispersion (9.26 Angstroms/channel) and the value in
        VxFLCAL.TAB corresponding to the center channel of the
        wavelength of interest. The resulting quantity is the
        brightness of a monochromatic emission that fills the field of
        view. For more complex spectra that include blended emissions,
        the most accurate approach is spectral analysis by generating
        synthetic spectra. This technique uses an iterative approach
        to adjust an estimated brightness spectrum until the model
        spectrum computed from it matches the observed spectrum. The
        model can be fairly simple, but must include the triangular
        transmission profile of the collimator and the instrument
        sensitivity (calibration). The calibration factor described
        earlier in this paragraph is the correct one to use for this
        kind of synthesis.
 
 
        Calibration and spectral analysis issues are discussed by
        [HOLBERGETAL1982] and [HOLBERG1986].
 
 
    Platform Mounting Descriptions
    ==============================
      The UVS is mounted on the scan platform.  The instrument is
      approximately bore-sighted with the wide and narrow angle
      television cameras, and with the PPS and IRIS instruments.  The
      alignment of the fields is not perfect; the following table
      gives offsets of the centers of the UVS fields relative to the
      centers of the ISS Narrow Angle Camera fields of view.
      Elevation is positive to the right within the imaging field of
      view, and cross-elevation is positive downward.  The narrow axis
      of the UVS slit is aligned with the elevation direction.

        small mirror.  The offset is toward lower elevation.  The
        elevation offsets are:

    Instrument Detector &apos;SPECTROMETER&apos;
    ==================================
      The windowless, photoevent-counting detector consists of an
      electron multiplier, a pair of microchannel plates (MCP) in
      series, and a 128-element linear self-scanned readout array.
      Photoelectrons ejected at the front of the MCP stack are
      amplified by a factor of about 1E6, and the resulting charge
      pulse is collected by the anode array.  The 128 narrow aluminum
      anodes, each 3 mm long, are deposited on 0.1-mm centers for a
      collecting length (in the dispersion direction) of 13 mm.
 
      The anodes are accessed sequentially by a shift register and
      FET switches contained on the single integrated circuit.  The
      scanning circuitry discharges each anode into a charge
      sensitive preamplifier.  The charge pulse is digitized and the
      information added into a shift register memory consisting of
      128 16-bit words.  The 128-anode array consists of two separate
      interdigitated 64-anode arrays scanned by two shift registers.
      The shift registers and memory are driven by a 200 kHz clock,
      so that an individual anode is accessed every 320 microsecond.
      The detector scan rate is therefore about 3125 Hz.
 
      Wavelengths shorter than about 0.1250 micron strike the MCP
      directly.  Longer wavelengths first pass through a MgF2 filter
      with a semi-transparent photocathode of CuI.  This serves to
      boost the quantum efficiency at long wavelengths and to reduce
      the response to second-order light.
 
      The detector is heavily shielded to reduce its response to
      trapped particle radiation.  A description of the detector may
      be found in [BROADFOOT&amp;SANDEL1977].

    Instrument Electronics &apos;UVS&apos;
    ============================
      The UVS electronics is housed in an enclosure integral with the
      optical section of instrument.  Most of the electronics is in
      the base of the instrument, but clock drive generators for the
      anode array and the first stage of charge sensitive
      preamplification of the analog signal processing electronics
      are mounted in the detector housing so that they are near the
      anode array.  Elements of the electronics complement include:
 
           (1)  Low voltage power supply
           (2)  High voltage power supply
           (3)  Clock drive generator for the anode array
           (4)  Analog signal processing electronics including A/D
                conversion
           (5)  128x16 bit accumulation memory for spectrum
           (6)  FDS interface
 
      The FDS interface sends data to the FDS on demand and accepts
      mode commands from the FDS.  The mode commands set the level of
      the high voltage applied to the MCPs of the detector and set
      the mode of analog signal processing (pulse counting or
      integration).
 
      Radiation-hard electronics components were used where possible,
      and spot radiation shielding was used to reduce the fluence at
      certain critical elements.
 
 
    Instrument Optics &apos;UVS&apos;
    =======================
      The optical system consists mainly of the mechanical collimator
      and concave diffraction grating.  The 13 aperture plates of the
      collimator establish a field of 0.1x0.87 degree for the airglow
      field and 0.25x0.87 degree for the occultation field.  The 0.1
      and 0.25 degree dimensions are in the dispersion direction, and
      the 0.87 degree dimension is in the cross-dispersion direction.
      The collimator provides separate light paths for the airglow
      and occultation ports, and a small mirror diverts the
      occultation field by 20 degrees from the airglow field.
 
      The concave diffraction grating is a platinum coated replica,
      ruled at 540 lines/mm, blazed at 0.0800 microns and having a
      spherical radius of curvature of 400.1 mm.  Dispersion in the
      image plane is 0.00926 microns/mm, or 0.000926 microns/channel.
      The grating substrate is a 4x6-cm rectangle, and the useful
      ruled area is 21 square cm.

    Instrument Mode &apos;PULSE COUNTING&apos;
    ================================
      Two modes of electrical operation allow the detector to operate
      in a photon-counting mode for low source intensities, or in an
      integration mode for high source intensities.  In the pulse
      counting mode, the number in the corresponding memory location
      is incremented by one if a charge above a fixed threshold is
      detected on an anode.  The access time of 320 microsec implies
      that single random photoevents can be recorded on any one of
      the anodes at a rate of about 300 Hz with a coincidence of 10%.
      The pulse-counting mode is used for all measurements except
      solar occultations.

    Instrument Mode &apos;PULSE INTEGRATION&apos;
    ===================================
      In the pulse integration mode a 3-bit A-to-D converter is
      introduced ahead of the adder.  In this case the charge on each
      anode is coarsely digitized and added to the previously
      accumulated signal in memory.  The statistics of sampling these
      events is complicated by the logarithmic pulse height
      distribution of the events.  There is also a logarithmic
      current limit function of the MCPs at the high event rates that
      normally obtain when this mode is used.  Because both these
      characteristics lead to non-linear response, modeling of the
      detector response is needed to restore linearity.  The
      integration mode is used for observing solar occultations.

      Instrument Description
      ======================
      The Voyager Plasma Science experiment consists of four
      modulated grid Faraday Cups, three (A,B,C) of which are
      positioned about the Telemetry Antenna Axis and generally
      point toward the Earth with the fourth (D) at a right angle to
      this direction.  Ion currents are sampled simultaneously in
      all four cups, electrons in the D-cup only.  The instrument
      has an energy/charge range of 10-5950 V.  Data is taken in
      four ways, high and low resolution ion modes and high and low
      energy electron modes, with energy resolution varying between
      3.6 and 29%.  The integration time for each energy channel can
      be varied are used at Jupiter and Saturn and 0.93 and 0.21
      second integration times are used at Uranus and Neptune.
      Supersonic flow can be observed only when one of the detectors
      points into the flow orientation allows determination of the
      plasma density, temperature, and velocity.
 
      Science Objectives
      ==================
      The objective of the Plasma Instrument is to characterize
      plasma conditions throughout the Voyager trajectory, in the
      solar wind and during the planetary encounters.
 
      Operational Considerations
      ==========================
      Each detector has an effective field of view which is a cone of
      half angle 45 degrees falls off quickly at higher angles.
      Thus, for the instrument to measure ion parameters in a
      Supersonic or Transonic plasma some of the detectors must look
      into the plasma flow. Secondary ions and electrons produced
      within the detectors can also effect the measurements,
      especially if large fluxes of hot ions or electrons are present
      and these effects are not well modeled. The instrument does
      not measure composition, only energy/charge, so a model of
      plasma composition must be adopted to fit the ion data choice
      of models can be unambiguous for large Mach number flow (M&gt;3)
      but is non-unique for lower Mach numbers. After the Jupiter
      encounter the highest channels of the A, B, and C detectors
      often contain spurious signal and currents in the upper half of
      the energy range should be examined carefully before use.
 
      Calibration Description
      =======================
      The instrument was calibrated at MIT using ion and electron
      beams and compared to output from other Faraday cups in the
      same beam. Current levels are also calibrated in-flight by
      injecting known currents into the detectors with the modulators
      on and off. Much theoretical modeling has been done on the
      response of the detectors to arbitrary plasma conditions.
      Contact the PI for more information.
 
      PLS Detectors &apos;A&apos;, &apos;B&apos;, &apos;C&apos;, and &apos;D&apos;
      ====================================
      Detector Type                  : FARADAY CUP
      Detector Aspect Ratio          : 0.000000
      Nominal Operating Temperature  : 278.000000
 
      The PLS instrument consists of four Faraday cups. Three of
      these (A, B, C) are arranged in a cone whose central axis is
      parallel to the direction of the telemetry antenna. The look
      direction of each of these cups is offset 20 degrees from the
      central axis. Detector D has a look direction approximately
      perpendicular to the direction of the telemetry antenna. Each
      detector consists of three modulator grids, six shield grids
      and a suppressor grid in front of the collector. It measures
      ion currents in the range 10-5950 V.
 
      Depending on the integration time the detectors measure current
      from a minimum of 3.e-14 to 2.e-13 AMPS up to a maximum of
      6.e-8 AMPS. Sampling varies from .03 to .93 seconds.

      Electronics
      ===========
      Currents from the four detectors are amplified, filtered, and
      integrated using four different measurement chains. A single
      8-bit logarithmic A-D converter samples the four outputs of the
      measurement chains and transfers the data to the spacecraft.
      The high voltage modulator supplies a DC pedestal and a super-
      imposed 400 HZ square wave modulation voltage. For positive
      ions the modulator grids of all four detectors are driven in
      parallel. A more complete description and block diagram of the
      instrument electronics is available in [BRIDGEETAL1977].
 
      Operating Modes

      Instrument Description
      ======================
      The Voyager Plasma Science experiment consists of four
      modulated grid Faraday Cups, three (A,B,C) of which are
      positioned about the Telemetry Antenna Axis and generally
      point toward the Earth with the fourth (D) at a right angle to
      this direction.  Ion currents are sampled simultaneously in
      all four cups, electrons in the D-cup only.  The instrument
      has an energy/charge range of 10-5950 V.  Data is taken in
      four ways, high and low resolution ion modes and high and low
      energy electron modes, with energy resolution varying between
      3.6 and 29%.  The integration time for each energy channel can
      be varied are used at Jupiter and Saturn and 0.93 and 0.21
      second integration times are used at Uranus and Neptune.
      Supersonic flow can be observed only when one of the detectors
      points into the flow orientation allows determination of the
      plasma density, temperature, and velocity.
 
      Science Objectives
      ==================
      The objective of the Plasma Instrument is to characterize
      plasma conditions throughout the Voyager trajectory, in the
      solar wind and during the planetary encounters.
 
      Operational Considerations
      ==========================
      Each detector has an effective field of view which is a cone of
      half angle 45 degrees falls off quickly at higher angles.
      Thus, for the instrument to measure ion parameters in a
      Supersonic or Transonic plasma some of the detectors must look
      into the plasma flow. Secondary ions and electrons produced
      within the detectors can also effect the measurements,
      especially if large fluxes of hot ions or electrons are present
      and these effects are not well modeled. The instrument does
      not measure composition, only energy/charge, so a model of
      plasma composition must be adopted to fit the ion data choice
      of models can be unambiguous for large Mach number flow (M&gt;3)
      but is non-unique for lower Mach numbers. After the Jupiter
      encounter the highest channels of the A, B, and C detectors
      often contain spurious signal and currents in the upper half of
      the energy range should be examined carefully before use.
 
      Calibration Description
      =======================
      The instrument was calibrated at MIT using ion and electron
      beams and compared to output from other Faraday cups in the
      same beam. Current levels are also calibrated in-flight by
      injecting known currents into the detectors with the modulators
      on and off. Much theoretical modeling has been done on the
      response of the detectors to arbitrary plasma conditions.
      Contact the PI for more information.
 
      PLS Detectors &apos;A&apos;, &apos;B&apos;, &apos;C&apos;, and &apos;D&apos;
      ====================================
      Detector Type                  : FARADAY CUP
      Detector Aspect Ratio          : 0.000000
      Nominal Operating Temperature  : 278.000000
 
      The PLS instrument consists of four Faraday cups. Three of
      these (A, B, C) are arranged in a cone whose central axis is
      parallel to the direction of the telemetry antenna. The look
      direction of each of these cups is offset 20 degrees from the
      central axis. Detector D has a look direction approximately
      perpendicular to the direction of the telemetry antenna. Each
      detector consists of three modulator grids, six shield grids
      and a suppressor grid in front of the collector. It measures
      ion currents in the range 10-5950 V.
 
      Depending on the integration time the detectors measure current
      from a minimum of 3.e-14 to 2.e-13 AMPS up to a maximum of
      6.e-8 AMPS. Sampling varies from .03 to .93 seconds.

      Electronics
      ===========
      Currents from the four detectors are amplified, filtered, and
      integrated using four different measurement chains. A single
      8-bit logarithmic A-D converter samples the four outputs of the
      measurement chains and transfers the data to the spacecraft.
      The high voltage modulator supplies a DC pedestal and a super-
      imposed 400 HZ square wave modulation voltage. For positive
      ions the modulator grids of all four detectors are driven in
      parallel. A more complete description and block diagram of the
      instrument electronics is available in [BRIDGEETAL1977].

  Instrument Overview
  ===================
    The low energy charged particle experiment employs a set of
    many solid state detectors arranged to characterize, with
    various levels of energy, directional, and compositional
    discriminations, the in-situ charged particle environment of
    the spacecraft, both within interplanetary and planetary
    magnetospheric regions.  Electrons can be characterized, with
    various electron rate energy channels, between 26 keV and
    greater than 10 meV (mode dependent).  Ions, without mass
    species discriminations, can be characterized with various ion
    rate energy channels between 30 keV and greater than 152 keV
    (mode dependent).  Rate data is telemetered as simple counts
    per accumulation time period.  The different channels
    correspond to different onboard energy discrimination windows
    (for ions the discrimination values are mass species dependent,
    leading to some ambiguity).  Above about 200 keV/nucleon, the
    ions can be discriminated as to their mass species composition
    by the use of multiple parameter measurements.  These
    measurements consist of the energies that individual particles
    deposit in more than one detector.  This information is
    telemetered both as ion rate data, obtained by on-board species
    identification circuitry (with various channels representing
    various energy-species combinations), and as particle multiple
    parameters data, consisting of pulse-height-analysis values
    from each of the affected particle detectors for each analyzed
    particle.  (A maximum of about 2 to 5 particles per second can
    be analyzed in this fashion due to telemetry limitations.  A
    priority scheme avoids saturation by one species group.  there
    are three such groups defined: atomic number z = 1,2 each group
    in a rotating fashion.) Angular information is obtained through
    mechanical rotation of the detectors.  The main detectors look
    within a single scan plane that is rotated 360 degrees,
    stopping at 8 different look sectors (one of the sectors is
    blocked to obtain a background measurement: sector 8).  The
    lower energy detectors have full width viewcones of about 45
    degrees.  The scan plane is oriented such that a line that
    passes exactly between sectors 8 and 1, and also exactly
    between sectors 4 and 5, is exactly parallel to the roll axis
    of the spacecraft (which nominally points at earth).  When the
    roll orientation of the spacecraft is such that the star sensor
    is locked on Canopus, the scan plane is tilted about 30 degrees
    out of the ecliptic plane, with sector 3 tilting towards north
    ecliptic (and also in the direction that is retrograde with
    respect to the planetary orbits).  Sectors 1 and 8 point in the
    general direction of earth.  The scan rate is variable between
    48 seconds to 48 minutes per 360 degree scan.  There are some
    electron detectors (whose properties are not as well
    established as the others) that view out of the scan plane
    described here (see [KRIMIGISETAL1977]).  Some of the data is
    subject to substantial contamination depending on the region
    under consideration.  Before the data from this instrument can
    be used, it is vital that the contamination descriptions be
    examined (&apos;CONTAMINATION_ DESC&apos;) for each contamination type
    (&apos;CONTAMINATION_ID&apos;) and that the contaminations levels be
    determined (&apos;DATA_QUALITY_ID&apos; AND &apos;DATA_QUALITY_DESC&apos;).  While
    sector 8 is the background sector for most (and generally the
    most used) data channels, sector 4 is the background sector for
    some channels.  Of those channels documented in this catalog,
    sector 4 is the background sector for channels: ESA0, ESB0,
    AB10, AB12, AB13, PSA1, PSA2, PSA3, PSB1, PSB2, AND PSB3.
 
 
  Science Objectives
  ==================
    Characterize the energy spectra, angular distributions, species
    composition, spatial structures, and temporal variations of the
    hot plasmas, energetic particles, and particulate radiation
    that exist in the vicinity of the outer planets (Jupiter,
    Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) and within the interplanetary
    environment.  To study the mechanisms by which such particles
    are energized and transported throughout such systems.  To
    study in particular the energization and transport processes
    associated with hot plasmas and particulate radiation in the
    vicinity of planetary bow shocks, magnetopauses, magnetotail
    plasma sheets, inner radiation zones, the auroral zones, etc.,
    and to study the interaction of such media with planetary
    satellites and the planetary atmospheres and ionospheres.
 
 
  Operational Considerations
  ==========================
    Instrument operates continuously sampling data over uniform
    accumulation intervals.  The accumulation intervals are
    different for the different channels of information (almost 100
    channels).  The scan head of the LECP Instrument usually scans
    back-and-forth continuously (forward by 315 degrees and then
    back by 315 degrees).  The scanning head pauses at 8 different
    scan sectors for periods ranging between 6 seconds and 48
    seconds (for the encounter time periods) and takes about 0.5
    seconds to scan between the sectors.  Specially scanning modes
    for Voyager 2 at Uranus and Neptune have been developed whereby
    1 or 2 quick scans are performed followed by 6 to 12 minutes of
    no scanning.  Also, for Voyager 2 at Jupiter there was an
    extended period of no scanning.  The roll orientation of the
    spacecraft is of crucial importance as to the type of data
    returned since that orientation determines the orientation of
    the scan plane of the LECP Instrument.  That orientation also
    has safety consequences since a poor orientation could expose
    the LECP detectors to ring particulate damage.
 
 
  Calibration
  ===========
    The instrument was calibrated on the ground by placing it into
    beam chambers (e.g.  Van DeGraf machines) and firing calibrated
    beams of known composition at it.  Also, a radioactive source
    is positioned behind the &apos;sunshield&apos; positioned at sector 8 for
    in-flight calibration of some detector-electronic gains.  Also,
    the instrument has a calibration mode whereby pulses of known
    strength are sent into the pre-amplifier chains following the
    detectors.  Information about calibration can be found in:
    [KRIMIGISETAL1977], [KRIMIGISETAL1981], [ARMSTRONGETAL1981],
    and [HAMILTONETAL1981].

    Detector Aspect Ratio          : 0.000000
    Nominal Operating Temperature  : 273.000000
 
    The LECP Instrument consists of a variety (about 28) of &apos;Solid
    State Detectors&apos; that are used individually and in combinations
    (using coincidence and anti-coincidence criterion) to detect
    and characterize nuclear particles.  The detector thicknesses
    range from 2 to 2450 microns to cover a very broad range of
    particle energy and mass characteristic.
 
    Detectors count particles that have appropriate discriminated
    characteristics with an efficiency that approaches 1.
    Therefore the sensitivity is strictly a function of the
    geometric factors of the detectors (geometric factors
    associated with different data channels are documented
    elsewhere in this catalog) and the energy and species
    band-widths of the data channels (also documented elsewhere).
    The geometric factors have units of area X Steradians (CM^2 X
    STR).

      Sampling Parameter Resolution  : 0.000000
      Sampling Parameter Unit        : ATOMIC NUMBER
 
      A set of measured parameters which yield multiple pieces of
      information about each particle (generally ions) that Q
      enters the system.  These pieces of information can, for
      example, consist of the energy deposited by a single particle
      in two or more separate detectors, or the time-of-flight
      between two different detectors plus the energy deposited in
      a third, etc..  The multiple pieces of information can be
      used to perform mass, atomic number, and/or charge state
      discriminations on ions.  The information can be
      discriminated on-board and telemetered in the form of ion
      rate channels, or the multiple information about each
      particle analyzed can be telemetered for obtaining the finest
      species discriminations.

    LECP Instrument is mounted on the science boom about half way
    between the boom&apos;s spacecraft anchor point and imaging scan
    platform.  The mounting is such that the 360 degree scan plane
    of the LECP scanning head (not to be confused with the scanning
    of the imaging instruments) is coplanar with the spacecraft&apos;s
    roll axis.  Also, on the Canopus star lock the LECP scan plane
    is about 30 degrees rotated away from the ecliptic plane.  A
    line passing between sectors 1 and 8, and between sectors 4 and
    5, is parallel to the spacecraft roll axis.  Sectors 1 and 8
    point in the general direction or earth, and with the Canopus
    lock, sector 3 points generally in the retrograde direction
    (referring to the direction with respect to the directions of
    motion of the orbiting planets) and about 30 degrees north of
    the ecliptic.

  Instrument Overview
  ===================
    The low energy charged particle experiment employs a set of
    many solid state detectors arranged to characterize, with
    various levels of energy, directional, and compositional
    discriminations, the in-situ charged particle environment of
    the spacecraft, both within interplanetary and planetary
    magnetospheric regions.  Electrons can be characterized, with
    various electron rate energy channels, between 26 keV and
    greater than 10 meV (mode dependent).  Ions, without mass
    species discriminations, can be characterized with various ion
    rate energy channels between 30 keV and greater than 152 keV
    (mode dependent).  Rate data is telemetered as simple counts
    per accumulation time period.  The different channels
    correspond to different onboard energy discrimination windows
    (for ions the discrimination values are mass species dependent,
    leading to some ambiguity).  Above about 200 keV/nucleon, the
    ions can be discriminated as to their mass species composition
    by the use of multiple parameter measurements.  These
    measurements consist of the energies that individual particles
    deposit in more than one detector.  This information is
    telemetered both as ion rate data, obtained by on-board species
    identification circuitry (with various channels representing
    various energy-species combinations), and as particle multiple
    parameters data, consisting of pulse-height-analysis values
    from each of the affected particle detectors for each analyzed
    particle.  (A maximum of about 2 to 5 particles per second can
    be analyzed in this fashion due to telemetry limitations.  A
    priority scheme avoids saturation by one species group.  there
    are three such groups defined: atomic number z = 1,2 each group
    in a rotating fashion.) Angular information is obtained through
    mechanical rotation of the detectors.  The main detectors look
    within a single scan plane that is rotated 360 degrees,
    stopping at 8 different look sectors (one of the sectors is
    blocked to obtain a background measurement: sector 8).  The
    lower energy detectors have full width viewcones of about 45
    degrees.  The scan plane is oriented such that a line that
    passes exactly between sectors 8 and 1, and also exactly
    between sectors 4 and 5, is exactly parallel to the roll axis
    of the spacecraft (which nominally points at earth).  When the
    roll orientation of the spacecraft is such that the star sensor
    is locked on Canopus, the scan plane is tilted about 30 degrees
    out of the ecliptic plane, with sector 3 tilting towards north
    ecliptic (and also in the direction that is retrograde with
    respect to the planetary orbits).  Sectors 1 and 8 point in the
    general direction of earth.  The scan rate is variable between
    48 seconds to 48 minutes per 360 degree scan.  There are some
    electron detectors (whose properties are not as well
    established as the others) that view out of the scan plane
    described here (see [KRIMIGISETAL1977]).  Some of the data is
    subject to substantial contamination depending on the region
    under consideration.  Before the data from this instrument can
    be used, it is vital that the contamination descriptions be
    examined (&apos;CONTAMINATION_ DESC&apos;) for each contamination type
    (&apos;CONTAMINATION_ID&apos;) and that the contaminations levels be
    determined (&apos;DATA_QUALITY_ID&apos; AND &apos;DATA_QUALITY_DESC&apos;).  While
    sector 8 is the background sector for most (and generally the
    most used) data channels, sector 4 is the background sector for
    some channels.  Of those channels documented in this catalog,
    sector 4 is the background sector for channels: ESA0, ESB0,
    AB10, AB12, AB13, PSA1, PSA2, PSA3, PSB1, PSB2, AND PSB3.
 
 
  Science Objectives
  ==================
    Characterize the energy spectra, angular distributions, species
    composition, spatial structures, and temporal variations of the
    hot plasmas, energetic particles, and particulate radiation
    that exist in the vicinity of the outer planets (Jupiter,
    Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) and within the interplanetary
    environment.  To study the mechanisms by which such particles
    are energized and transported throughout such systems.  To
    study in particular the energization and transport processes
    associated with hot plasmas and particulate radiation in the
    vicinity of planetary bow shocks, magnetopauses, magnetotail
    plasma sheets, inner radiation zones, the auroral zones, etc.,
    and to study the interaction of such media with planetary
    satellites and the planetary atmospheres and ionospheres.
 
 
  Operational Considerations
  ==========================
    Instrument operates continuously sampling data over uniform
    accumulation intervals.  The accumulation intervals are
    different for the different channels of information (almost 100
    channels).  The scan head of the LECP Instrument usually scans
    back-and-forth continuously (forward by 315 degrees and then
    back by 315 degrees).  The scanning head pauses at 8 different
    scan sectors for periods ranging between 6 seconds and 48
    seconds (for the encounter time periods) and takes about 0.5
    seconds to scan between the sectors.  Specially scanning modes
    for Voyager 2 at Uranus and Neptune have been developed whereby
    1 or 2 quick scans are performed followed by 6 to 12 minutes of
    no scanning.  Also, for Voyager 2 at Jupiter there was an
    extended period of no scanning.  The roll orientation of the
    spacecraft is of crucial importance as to the type of data
    returned since that orientation determines the orientation of
    the scan plane of the LECP Instrument.  That orientation also
    has safety consequences since a poor orientation could expose
    the LECP detectors to ring particulate damage.
 
 
  Calibration
  ===========
    The instrument was calibrated on the ground by placing it into
    beam chambers (e.g.  Van DeGraf machines) and firing calibrated
    beams of known composition at it.  Also, a radioactive source
    is positioned behind the &apos;sunshield&apos; positioned at sector 8 for
    in-flight calibration of some detector-electronic gains.  Also,
    the instrument has a calibration mode whereby pulses of known
    strength are sent into the pre-amplifier chains following the
    detectors.  Information about calibration can be found in:
    [KRIMIGISETAL1977], [KRIMIGISETAL1981], [ARMSTRONGETAL1981],
    and [HAMILTONETAL1981].

    Detector Aspect Ratio          : 0.000000
    Nominal Operating Temperature  : 273.000000
 
    The LECP Instrument consists of a variety (about 28) of &apos;Solid
    State Detectors&apos; that are used individually and in combinations
    (using coincidence and anti-coincidence criterion) to detect
    and characterize nuclear particles.  The detector thicknesses
    range from 2 to 2450 microns to cover a very broad range of
    particle energy and mass characteristic.
 
    Detectors count particles that have appropriate discriminated
    characteristics with an efficiency that approaches 1.
    Therefore the sensitivity is strictly a function of the
    geometric factors of the detectors (geometric factors
    associated with different data channels are documented
    elsewhere in this catalog) and the energy and species
    band-widths of the data channels (also documented elsewhere).
    The geometric factors have units of area X Steradians (CM^2 X
    STR).

      A set of measured parameters which yield multiple pieces of
      information about each particle (generally ions) that Q
      enters the system.  These pieces of information can, for
      example, consist of the energy deposited by a single particle
      in two or more separate detectors, or the time-of-flight
      between two different detectors plus the energy deposited in
      a third, etc..  The multiple pieces of information can be
      used to perform mass, atomic number, and/or charge state
      discriminations on ions.  The information can be
      discriminated on-board and telemetered in the form of ion
      rate channels, or the multiple information about each
      particle analyzed can be telemetered for obtaining the finest
      species discriminations.

  ===================
    Cone Offset Angle              : UNK
    Cross Cone Offset Angle        : UNK
    Twist Offset Angle             : UNK
 
    LECP Instrument is mounted on the science boom about half way
    between the boom&apos;s spacecraft anchor point and imaging scan
    platform.  The mounting is such that the 360 degree scan plane
    of the LECP scanning head (not to be confused with the scanning
    of the imaging instruments) is coplanar with the spacecraft&apos;s
    roll axis.  Also, on the Canopus star lock the LECP scan plane
    is about 30 degrees rotated away from the ecliptic plane.  A
    line passing between sectors 1 and 8, and between sectors 4 and
    5, is parallel to the spacecraft roll axis.  Sectors 1 and 8
    point in the general direction or earth, and with the Canopus
    lock, sector 3 points generally in the retrograde direction
    (referring to the direction with respect to the directions of
    motion of the orbiting planets) and about 30 degrees north of
    the ecliptic.

This 0.79-meter (31-inch) telescope was installed in 1964 at Lowell&#8217;s Anderson Mesa
Dark Sky Site. The U.S. Geological Survey originally operated it to create geological
maps of the Moon, in support of Project Apollo. Ownership was transferred to Lowell
Observatory in 1972, and it was refurbished in 1990.

This telescope later became a primary research tool for the National Undergraduate
Research Observatory (NURO).

The effective focal length is 11.78 m, and the f/ratio is 15.

The 31-inch telescope is stopped down to 29.5 inches (0.75m). 
The plate scale is 17 arcsec/mm.</field>
