Mission Overview                                                      
================                                                      
Mars Express was the first flexible mission of the revised long-term  
ESA Science Programme Horizons 2000 and was launched to the planet    
Mars from Baikonur (Kazakhstan) on June 2nd 2003.  A Soyuz-Fregat     
launcher injected the Mars Express total mass of about 1200 kg into   
Mars transfer orbit. Details about the mission launch sequence and    
profile can be obtained from the Mission Plan (MEX-MMT-RP-0221) and   
from the Consolidated Report on Mission Analysis (CREMA)(MEX-ESC-RP-  
5500).                                                                
The mission consisted of (i) a 3-axis stabilized orbiter with a fixed 
high-gain antenna and body-mounted instruments, and (ii) a lander     
named BEAGLE-2, and was dedicated to the orbital and in-situ study of 
the interior, subsurface, surface and atmosphere of the planet. After 
ejection of a small lander on 18 December 2003 and Mars orbit         
insertion (MOI) on 25 December 2003, the orbiter experiments began    
the acquisition of scientific data from Mars and its environment in a 
polar elliptical orbit.                                               
The nominal mission lifetime for the orbiter was 687 days following   
Mars orbit insertion, starting after a 5 months cruise. The nominal   
science phase was extended (tbc) for another Martian year in order to 
complement earlier observations and allow data relay communications   
for various potential Mars landers up to 2008, provided that the      
spacecraft resources permit it.                                       
                                                                      
The Mars Express spacecraft represented the core of the mission,      
being scientifically justified on its own by investigations such as   
high- resolution imaging and mineralogical mapping of the surface,    
radar sounding of the subsurface structure down to the permafrost,    
precise determination of the atmospheric circulation and composition, 
and study of the interaction of the atmosphere with the               
interplanetary medium. The broad scientific objectives of the orbiter 
payload are briefly listed thereafter and are given more extensively  
in the experiment publications contained in ESA's Special Publication 
Series. See NEUKUM&JAUMANN2004, BIBRINGETAL2004, PICARDIETAL2004,     
FORMISANOETAL2004, BERTAUXETAL2004, PAETZOLDETAL2004 and              
PULLANETAL2004.                                                       
                                                                      
The Mars Express lander Beagle-2 was ejected towards the Mars surface 
on 19 December 2003, six days before the orbiters capture manoeuvre.  
The probe mass was limited to about 70 kg by the mission constraints, 
which led to a landed mass of 32 kg. The complete experimental        
package was weighed in approximately at 9kg. The landers highly       
integrated scientific payload was supposed to focus on finding        
whether there is convincing evidence for past life on Mars or         
assessing if the conditions were ever suitable. Following safe        
landing on Mars, this lander mission would have conducted dedicated   
studies of the geology, mineralogy, geochemistry, meteorology and     
exobiology of the immediate landing site located in Isidis Planitia   
(90.74?E, 11.6?N), as well as studies of the chemistry of the Martian 
atmosphere. Surface operations were planned to last about 180 sols or 
Martian days ( about 6 months on Earth), see SIMSETAL1999. As no      
communication could be established to the BEAGLE-2 lander, it was     
considered lost in February 2004 after an extensive 'search'.         
                                                                      
A nominal launch of Mars Express allowed the modify the orbit to a    
'G3-ubeq100' orbit. The 'G3-ubeq100' orbit is an elliptical orbit,    
starting with the sub-spacecraft point at pericentre at the equator   
and a sun elevation of 60 degrees.                                    
At the beginning of the mission, the pericentre moves southward with  
a shift of 0.54 degree per day. At the same time the pericentre steps 
towards the terminator which will be reached after about 4 months,    
giving the optical instruments optimal observing conditions during    
this initial period. Throughout this initial phase lasting until mid- 
May 2004, the downlink rate will decrease from 114 kbit/s to          
38 kbit/s.                                                            
After an orbit change manoeuvre on 06 May 2004 the pericentre         
latitude motion is increased to guarantee a 50/50 balance between     
dayside and nightside operations. With this manoeuvre, the apocentre  
altitude is lowered from 14887 km to 13448 km, the orbital period     
lowered from ~7.6 hours to 6.645 hours, and the pericentre latitude   
drift slightly increased to 0.64 degree per day.                      
After 150 days, at the beginning of June 2004, the South pole region  
was reached with the pericentre already behind the terminator.        
Following, the pericentre moves northward with the Sun elevation      
increasing. Thus, the optical instruments covered the Northern Mars   
hemisphere under good illumination conditions from mid-September 2004 
to March 2005.                                                        
During the next mission phase, lasting until July 2005, the           
pericentre was again in the dark. It covered the North polar region   
and moves southward.                                                  
Finally, throughout the last 4 months of the nominal mission, the     
pericentre was back to daylight and moves from the equator to the     
South pole, and the downlink rate reached its highest rate of 228     
kbit/s. The osculating orbit elements for the eq100 orbit are listed  
below:

Science Subphases                                                     
=================                                                     
For the purpose of structuring further the payload operations         
planning, the mission phases are further divided into science         
subphases. The science subphases are defined according to operational 
restrictions, the main operational restrictions being the downlink    
rate and the Sun elevation.                                           
                                                                      
The Mars Commissioning Phase and the Mars Routine Phase are therefore 
divided into a number of science subphases using various combinations 
of Sun elevations and available downlink bit rates.                   
                                                                      
The discrete downlink rates available throughout the nominal mission  
are:                                                                  
 -  28 kbits/seconds                                                  
 -  38 kbits/seconds                                                  
 -  45 kbits/seconds                                                  
 -  57 kbits/seconds                                                  
 -  76 kbits/seconds                                                  
 -  91 kbits/seconds                                                  
 - 114 kbits/seconds

When folded up Beagle 2 resembles a pocket watch. However, as soon as 
it comes to a halt on the Martian surface its outer casting will open 
to reveal the inner workings. Firstly the solar panels will unfold -  
catching sunlight the charge the batteries which will power the       
lander and its experiments throughout the mission. Next, a robotic    
arm will spring to life. Attached to the end of the arm is the PAW    
(Position Adjustable Workload) where most of the experiments are      
located. These include a pair of stereo cameras, a microscope, two    
types of spectrometer, and a torch to illuminate surfaces. The PAW    
also houses the corer/grinder and the mole, two devices for           
collecting rock and soil samples for analysis.                        
                                                                      
                                                                      
Scientific Objectives                                                 
                                                                      
 Gas Analysis Package                                                 
  This is where investigations most relevant to detecting past or     
  present life will be conducted. The instrument has twelve ovens in  
  which rock and soil samples can be heated gradually in the presence 
  of oxygen. The carbon dioxide generated at each temperature will be 
  delivered to a mass spectrometer, which will measure its abundance
  and the ratio of carbon-12 to carbon-13. The mass spectrometer will 
  also study other elements and look for methane in samples of        
  atmosphere. The temperature at which the carbon dioxide is          
  generated will reveal its nature, as different carbon bearing       
  materials combust at different temperatures.                        
                                                                      
 Environmental sensors                                                
   A variety of tiny sensors scattered about the Beagle 2 lander will 
   measure different aspects of the Martian environment including     
   atmospheric pressure ,air temperature and wind speed and           
   direction; ultra-violet (UV radiation; dust fall out and the       
   density and pressure of the upper atmosphere during Beagle 2's     
   descent through the atmosphere.                                    
                                                                      
 Two stereo cameras                                                   
   The cameras will provide digital pictures from which a 3D model of 
   the area within the reach of the robotic arm may be constructed.   
   As the PAW cannot be operated in real time from Earth, this 3D     
   model will be used to guide the instruments into position          
   alongside target rocks and soil and to provide information on the  
   geological setting of the landing site.                            
                                                                      
 Microscope                                                           
  The microscope will pick out features a few thousandths of a        
  millimetre across on rock surfaces exposed by the grinder. It will  
  reveal the texture of the rock, which will help determine whether   
  it is of sedimentary or volcanic origin.                            
                                                                      
 Mossbauer Spectrometer                                               
  It will investigate the mineral composition of rocks by irradiating 
  exposed rock surfaces and soil with gamma rays emitted by an        
  isotopic source, cobalt-57, and then measuring the spectrum of the  
  gamma-rays reflected back. In particular, the nature of the iron    
  minerals in the pristine interior and weathered surface of the      
  rocks will be compared to determine the oxidising nature of the     
  present atmosphere.                                                 
                                                                      
 X-ray spectrometer                                                   
  This will measure the elemental composition of rocks by bombarding  
  exposed rock surfaces with X-rays from four radioactive sources     
  (two iron-55 and two cadmium-109). The rocks will emit lower energy 
  X-rays characteristic of the elements present. Rock ages will be    
  estimated using the property that the isotope potassium-40 decays   
  to argon-40. The X-ray spectrometer will provide the potassium      
  measure and the GAP will measure argon trapped in rocks.            
                                                                      
 Mole                                                                 
  The mole will be able to crawl up to several metres across the      
  surface at a rate of 1cm every six seconds. Once it has reached a   
  boulder, it will burrow underground to collect samples in a cavity  
  in its tip. Alternatively, the PAW can be positioned such that the  
  mole will burrow underground to collect samples possibly 1.5m below 
  the surface.                                                        
                                                                      
 Corer/Grinder                                                        
   The corer/grinder consists of a drill bit which can either be      
   moved over a surface to remove weathered material, or be           
   positioned in one spot to drill a core of hopefully pristine       
   samples."
