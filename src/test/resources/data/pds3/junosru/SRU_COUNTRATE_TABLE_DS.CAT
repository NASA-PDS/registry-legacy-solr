    Data Set Overview
    =================

    This data set contains count rate tables derived from the Juno
    Stellar Reference Unit (SRU) EDR images.

    This data set uses the Committee on Data Management
    and Computation (CODMAC) data level numbering system.
    The SRU count rate tables are considered Level 5 or Derived Data
    (equivalent to NASA Level 1C). 


    Processing
    ==========

    SRU count rate tables are produced in '.CSV' format and consist of
    comma-delimited values.


    Data
    ====
      
    SRU count rate tables (CRTs) contain derived electron count rates from 
    a series of SRU images acquired during an orbit. The process by which 
    these are derived is explained in the Software Interface Specification 
    (SIS): Stellar Reference Unit Standard Data Products. Typically these SRU 
    images are taken near perijove. Image processing includes geometric 
    correction, star identification and removal, hot pixel removal, and count 
    rate detection. One of two methods of count rate quantification is used, 
    depending on the noise level observed in the image. Details of this 
    processing are described in the SIS.

    One count rate table (CRT) will be produced for each orbit. Within one 
    orbit's table, each row will represent the derived count rate from 
    one SRU image. The count rate values are derived from one of the two 
    measurement techniques described in the SIS, indicated by a valid value 
    in either column 4 or 5. The measurement technique will be chosen based 
    on the overall radiation-induced noise level of that image. 

    There are six fields in the table. The columns are as follows: SCET (UTC) 
    corresponding to midpoint of SRU image exposure; SCLK corresponding to 
    midpoint of SRU image exposure (following conversion from the native 
    format provided in the Event Verification Record (EVR) which telemeters 
    the SRU-generated image time tag); Identification number of the SRU that 
    the image was taken with; Detected count rate ('cluster' counts per 
    square cm of CCD area per second), if valid; Derived rate of deposited 
    noise signal ('DN' per pixel per second), if valid; Derived count rate 
    per square cm of CCD area per second using one of the previous methods 
    that is valid. Column 4 or 5 will have a value of 1.0E-31 if that 
    measurement technique is not valid; in that case the other column will 
    have a valid value.

    Each table product has two parts: the table itself with the extension 
    of 'CSV' and a detached label with an extension of 'LBL'. 

    Refer to the Stellar Reference Unit Standard Data Products Software 
    Interface Specification (SIS) for further details on these data products.
