      Data Set Overview
      =================

      This data set includes the complete set of JUNO SPICE data files
      (``kernel files''), which can be accessed using SPICE software.
      The SPICE data contain geometric and other ancillary information
      needed to recover the full value of science instrument data. In
      particular SPICE kernels provide spacecraft and planetary
      ephemerides, instrument mounting alignments, spacecraft
      orientation, and data needed for relevant time conversions.

      This data set is contained on a single virtual volume,
      JNOSP_1000, including data from all mission phases and covering
      from launch through the end time of the latest spacecraft
      attitude file supplied in the data set. Until the end of the
      spacecraft lifespan this data set is accumulating with new data
      added approximately every three to six months.

      Data Types (SPICE kernel types)
      ===============================

      SPK kernels contain ephemerides for spacecraft, planets,
      satellites, comets and asteroids as well as for moving or fixed
      spacecraft and instrument structures. They provide position and
      velocity, given in a Cartesian reference frame. SPK files are
      located under the ``data/spk'' directory of this data set.

      PCK kernels contain certain physical, dynamical and cartographic
      constants for target bodies, such as size and shape
      specifications, and orientation of the spin axis and prime
      meridian. PCK files are located under the ``data/pck'' directory
      of this data set.

      IK kernels (Instrument description kernels) give descriptive and
      operational data peculiar to a particular scientific instrument,
      such as internal timing relative to the spacecraft clock and
      field-of-view model parameters. IK files are located under the
      ``data/ik'' directory of this data set.

      CK kernels describe pointing, containing a transformation
      traditionally called the C-matrix which is used to determine
      time-tagged pointing (orientation) angles for a spacecraft
      structure upon which science instruments are mounted. CK files
      are located under the ``data/ck'' directory of this data set.

      EK (Events) kernels are derived from the integrated sequence of
      events used to produce actual spacecraft commands. EK files are
      located under the ``data/ek'' directory of this data set.

      LSK (Leapseconds) kernels contain the leapseconds and the values
      of other constants required to perform a transformation between
      Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) and Ephemeris time (ET). LSK
      files are located under the ``data/lsk'' directory of this data
      set.

      SCLK (Spacecraft Clock) kernels contain on-board clock
      calibration data required to perform a mapping between Ephemeris
      time (ET) and spacecraft on-board time (SCLK). SCLK files are
      located under the ``data/sclk'' directory of this data set.

      FK (Frame Definitions) kernels contain information required to
      define reference frames, sources of frame orientation data and
      connections between these frames and other frames supported
      within the SPICE system. This includes mounting alignment
      information for each instrument. FK files are located under the
      ``data/fk'' directory of this data set.


      Kernel File Details
      ===================

      A brief overview of the different types of JUNO kernels included
      in this data set is provided in the CONFIDENCE_LEVEL_NOTE section
      of this file while details specific to individual files are found
      in the ``*info.txt'' files in the corresponding data directory.
      The most detailed description of the data in each file is
      provided in metadata included inside the file -- in the
      description area of text kernels or in the comment area of binary
      kernels.


      Software
      ========

      The SPICE Toolkit contains software modules needed to read SPICE
      kernel files. SPICE software is highly documented via internal
      headers. Additional documentation is available in separate ASCII
      text files called Required Reading files. For example, the S- and
      P- Kernel (SPK) Required Reading File, named SPK.REQ, describes
      use of the SPK kernel file readers and contains sample programs.

      The latest SPICE Toolkit for a variety of computer platforms such
      as PC, Mac, SUN, etc. is available at the NAIF Node of PDS
      electronically (via anonymous FTP and WWW servers). Refer to
      information in ``software/softinfo.txt'' for details regarding
      obtaining this software. Each version of the Toolkit is also
      archived at the NASA National Space Science Data Center.


      Loading Kernel Files into a SPICE-based Application
      ===================================================

      The easiest way to make data from a collection of SPICE kernels
      available to a SPICE-based application is to list these kernels
      in a meta-kernel and load it into the program using the high
      level SPICE data loader routine FURNSH. This data set provides
      such meta-kernel(s) under the ``extras/mk'' directory. For more
      information about the JUNO meta-kernel(s), see the file
      ``extras/mk/mkinfo.txt''.

      "

    CONFIDENCE_LEVEL_NOTE            = "

      This data set contains SPICE kernel files created during mission
      operations and after mission data reconstruction and analysis.
      Some general information about this collection follows here, but
      the prospective user is also referred to extensive descriptions
      about each file that are stored inside each kernel file. These
      metadata provide detailed information regarding the information
      source from which the data were derived, the type of processing
      applied to the source data, applicability of the data, etc.
      Metadata are located in the ``comment area'' for binary kernel
      types (SPK, CK, ESQ), accessible using either the COMMNT or
      SPACIT utility program found in the NAIF Toolkit. Metadata are
      located after ``\begintext'' markers within the text kernel types
      (PCK, IK, FK, LSK, SCLK, MK), accessible by using any available
      text file display tool such as a word processor, text editor, or
      the unix ``more'' or ``cat'' commands.

      Where there are questions about data accuracy or ``confidence''
      not addressed herein the reader is invited to contact the NAIF
      node of the Planetary Data System for possible further
      information.

      SPK Files
      =========

      SPK files contain ephemerides for spacecraft, planets,
      satellites, comets and asteroids as well as for moving or fixed
      spacecraft and instrument structures.

      Three kinds of SPK files are provided in this archive: SPK files
      for the spacecraft orbit, SPK files for the Solar System planets
      and satellites, and SPK files for the relative locations of
      selected spacecraft structures.

      The spacecraft orbit SPK files contain the reconstructed
      spacecraft trajectory determined by the JUNO Navigation (NAV)
      Team, JPL. The informal 1-sigma uncertainty for the JUNO
      spacecraft reconstruction during cruise is on the order of 25
      kilometers while the informal 1-sigma uncertainty for the JUNO
      spacecraft reconstruction during perijove passes is on the order
      1 kilometer.

      This data set also includes the orbit number files generated
      during the mission using the NAIF's ORBNUM utility program. These
      files are not SPICE kernels; for this reason they are provided in
      the ``extras/orbnum'' directory. For more information about the
      JUNO orbit number files, see the file
      ``extras/orbnum/orbinfo.txt''.

      The DE436 planetary ephemeris SPK file included in this data set
      contains ephemeris data for the Solar System planet barycenters,
      Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Moon. The JUP310 SPK file
      included in this data set contain ephemeris data for the eight
      largest Jovian satellites. These versions of ephemerides were
      officially used by the project during mission operations. The
      accuracy information for these ephemerides is provided in the
      memos released with this data by the Solar System Dynamics (SSD)
      group, JPL.

      The JUNO structures SPK file included in this archive provides
      relative locations of the High Gain Antenna (HGA) and MAG
      sensors. The data included in the file are based of the
      dimensions from the spacecraft engineering drawings.

      More information about JUNO SPK files is available in the file
      ``data/spk/spkinfo.txt''.


      CK Files
      ========

      CK files provide time-varying orientation data for the
      spacecraft, and its structures and science instruments.

      Seven kinds of C-kernel files are provided in this archive: the
      reconstructed spacecraft bus (SC) orientation CKs; the low-
      accuracy reconstructed SC orientation CKs; the MAG Advanced
      Stellar Compass (ASC) Camera Head Units (CHU) and Magnetometer
      Optical Benches (MOB) reconstructed, inertially referenced
      attitude CKs; the MAG ASC CHU and MOB averaged alignment,
      spacecraft frame referenced CKs; the MAG MOB temperature-based
      alignment, spacecraft frame referenced CKs; the MAG MOB fixed
      alignment, spacecraft frame referenced CKs; and the merged UVS
      reconstructed orientation CKs.

      The reconstructed spacecraft bus orientation CKs were created by
      NAIF from reconstructed attitude products (ATT_RECON DRFs)
      generated by the Spacecraft Team, LMCO by post-processing on the
      ground the attitude data from engineering telemetry. As reported
      by the Spacecraft team, the attitude reconstruction accuracy as
      applies to the reconstructed attitude quaternions in the
      ATT_RECON DRFs, inside of PJ-14 hours to PJ+4 hours is 0.41 mrad
      per axis, 3-sigma (note that long star outages could affect
      this); outside perijove time periods -- 1.0 mrad per axis,
      3-sigma, excluding any precessions activities, including repoints
      and large precessions (e.g., to/from MWR attitudes) and any
      delta-v maneuver activity (TCM, DSM, JOI, OTM, BTM, APO, BPO,
      STM, etc); for the remainder of the time -- during any precession
      or delta-v maneuver activity the errors can be much larger due to
      thruster pulsing and nutation (based on maneuver performance up
      to Jun 2017, accuracy is probably within 3 mrad/axis during these
      delta-v maneuvers) and during precessions (and repoints) the
      errors depend upon the size of the precession. The angular
      momentum vector accuracy, as applies to the specific angular
      momentum vectors in the ATT_RECON DRFs, is 0.15 mrad total angle,
      3-sigma, excluding any precessions activities (repoints and large
      precessions, e.g., to/from MWR attitudes) and any delta-v
      maneuver activity (TCM, DSM, JOI, OTM, BTM, APO, BPO, STM, etc);
      for the remainder of the time -- during any precession or delta-v
      maneuver activity the errors can be much larger due to thruster
      pulsing, which affect the angular momentum vector suddenly and
      significantly while the available telemetry is not sufficient to
      reconstruct these sudden shifts.

      The low-accuracy reconstructed spacecraft bus orientation CKs
      were created by NAIF from low-frequency channelized attitude
      telemetry. They are provided only for anomaly periods not covered
      by the reconstructed spacecraft CKs. During these periods the
      attitude provided by these low-accuracy CKs is good to 0.1-0.25
      degrees for ``quiet'' intervals with relatively dense data points
      but has errors of many tens of degrees during spacecraft attitude
      maneuvers (spin-ups, precession re-pointings, etc) and during
      intervals with very sparse attitude data points (points spaced
      hours or even days apart).

      The reconstructed MAG ASC CHU/MOB CKs were created by NAIF from
      CHU channelized telemetry. They provide inertially referenced
      orientation for each of the four CHUs (A, B, C, and D) and two
      MOBs (in-board and out-board). The accuracy and coverage of the
      attitude stored in these CKs varies depending on downlinked data
      frequency and CHU performance. When used in MAG data processing
      these CKs occasionally introduce unfavorable oscillating
      signatures.

      The averaged alignment, spacecraft frame referenced MAG ASC
      CHU/MOB CKs were created by NAIF by differencing comparing
      inertially referenced spacecraft and CHU/MOB orientations
      provided in their corresponding reconstructed CKs. The
      time-varying CHU and MOB alignments eliminate oscillating
      signatures seen when using the reconstructed MAG ASC CHU/MOB CKs
      but due to the simplistic approach used to derive them might
      introduce show changing biases in the inertially referenced MAG
      attitude solutions. It is possible that better alignment CKs
      resulting from more sophisticated modeling and superseding these
      CKs will be added to the data set in a later release.

      The temperature-based alignment, spacecraft frame referenced MAG
      MOB CKs were created by the MAG Team, GSFC using the DTU solar
      array and SRU bracket thermal distortion model. These CKs, more
      accurate than the averaged alignment CKs but covering only few
      day periods around perijoves, were used by the MAG Team to
      process their perijove data.

      The fixed alignment, spacecraft frame referenced MAG MOB CKs were
      created by NAIF. These CKs do not contain actual alignment data.
      Instead they contain zero-offset ``connection'' segments
      providing access to fixed alignment data stored in the FK.
      Together with the FK these CKs allow computing MAG sensors
      orientation accurate to better than 0.5 milliradian between
      perijoves but are in error of more than one milliradian around
      perijoves. These CKs were used by the MAG Team to process their
      data between perijoves.

      The merged UVS reconstructed orientation CKs provide actual
      telemetry-based orientation of the JUNO UVS instrument
      observation frame. They were created by NAIF by merging
      individual UVS CKs produced by the UVS Team, SWRI.

      More information about JUNO CK files is available in the file
      ``data/ck/ckinfo.txt''.


      PCK Files
      =========

      PCK files provide size, shape and orientation data for ``target''
      bodies such as Jupiter, Europa, and Earth. A description of these
      data items and reference to their source is provided inside the
      PCK file, which is a simple text file that can be viewed using
      any word processor, text editor or text display utility.

      The generic PCK file included in this data set is based on the
      IAU/IAG/COSPAR values accepted in 2009.

      More information about the PCK files included in this data set is
      available in the file ``data/pck/pckinfo.txt''.


      FK Files
      ========

      Frames kernel files provide definitions of the reference frames
      specifying their names, types, and relationships to other frames.

      The JUNO mission FK file provided in this data set contains the
      complete set of frame definitions for the spacecraft, its
      structures such as solar array and antennas, and all of its
      science instruments. Meta information provided in the comments
      included in this file consists of the frame definitions,
      description of the frame relationships, source of and accuracy of
      the mounting alignment information, etc.

      More information about the JUNO FK files is available in the file
      ``data/fk/fkinfo.txt''.


      IK Files
      ========

      Instrument kernel files provide specifications for geometric
      parameters and--where applicable--field-of-view size, shape and
      orientation for the named instruments. Metadata describing these
      estimates are provided in each IK file included in this archive.
      Parameter values were determined from pre-launch measurements,
      instrument parameters specification documents, and in some cases
      from analysis of in-flight calibration data. The accuracy
      estimates for these data vary from instrument to instrument and,
      where available, are included in the IK internal comments.

      This data set includes IK files for all instruments on the JUNO
      spacecraft.

      Because the sets of geometric parameters included in the IKs vary
      from instrument to instrument users are encouraged to carefully
      examine the IKs before using them.

      More information about JUNO IK files is available in the file
      ``data/ik/ikinfo.txt''.


      SCLK Files
      ==========

      Spacecraft Clock kernel files provide a tabulation of data needed
      for converting time measurements between ephemeris time (ET) and
      spacecraft clock time (SCLK).

      The JUNO SPICE SCLK files were made from similar files--SCLK/SCET
      files, or SCLKvSCET files--produced by another mission entity.
      Each newly made SCLK file fully replaces the previous SCLK file.
      For JUNO, the time correlation accuracy provided in the SCLK
      kernel files for the Jupiter orbital operations time period is
      informally reported to be better than 10-20 milliseconds.

      SPICE software does not prohibit an SCLK file from being used for
      time conversions occurring for ``future times'' (or more
      accurately, for epochs that occur later than the epoch of the
      last telemetry data used in producing the last correlation
      coefficients found in the SCLK file). Such ``predict'' time
      conversions are likely to be inaccurate (changed somewhat) once
      the epoch of interest has been passed.

      More information about the JUNO SCLK files is available in the
      file ``data/sclk/sclkinfo.txt''.


      LSK Files
      =========

      Leapseconds kernel files provide a tabulation of ``leapseconds''
      and some other terms used in converting time measurements between
      ephemeris time (ET) and Universal Time (UTC). ``Spacecraft Event
      Time'' (SCET) is the commonly used name for UTC events measured
      at the spacecraft.

      Metadata describing how the LSK data are obtained or computed is
      contained inside the LSK text file. The time conversion provided
      by SPICE LSK files is accurate to approximately 0.000030 seconds.

      More information about the LSK files is available in the file
      ``data/lsk/lskinfo.txt''.

      EK Files
      ========

      The JUNO project did not produce any EK files; therefore, no EKs
      are included in this data set.
