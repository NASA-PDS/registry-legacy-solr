  Instrument Host Overview
  =========================
 
For most Juno experiments, data were collected by instruments on
the spacecraft then relayed via the orbiter telemetry system to stations of
the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN).  Radio Science required the DSN for its
data acquisition on the ground.  The following sections provide an
overview, first of the orbiter, then the science instruments, and
finally the DSN ground system.
 
 
  Instrument Host Overview - Spacecraft
  =======================================
 
Juno launched on August 5, 2011. The spacecraft used a delta V - EGA
trajectory consisting of deep space maneuvers on August 30, and September
14, 2012 followed by an Earth gravity assist on 9 October 2013 at an
altitude of ~500 km. Juno arrived at Jupiter in July 2016 using a 53.5-day
capture orbit prior to commencing operations for a prime mission comprising
32 high inclination, high eccentricity orbits of Jupiter.  The orbit is
polar (~90deg inclination) with a periapsis altitude of ~4,500 km and a
semi-major axis of ~57 RJ giving an orbital period of about 53 days.
Data were not acquired during Jupiter Orbit Insertion (Perijove 0) nor
during Perijove 2. See MISSION.CAT for details of the mission.
 
Juno is a spin-stabilized spacecraft equipped for 10 diverse science
investigations plus a camera included for education and public outreach.
The spacecraft includes one high gain (HGA), two low gain antennas (LGAs),
a toroidal medium gain antenna, a large set of solar arrays in three
&apos;wings&apos;, a main engine, and attitude thrusters.  In this description
Juno will frequently be called &apos;the spacecraft.&apos;
 
 
   Spacecraft Description
   ===================
 
Juno is a spin-stabilized with a large spin-to-transverse moment of
inertia ratio.  It is solar powered with 3 large, deployable rigid-panel
wings that can be moved to adjust the spin axis to the HGA boresight.
The solar panels are spaced at 120 deg. intervals around a basic
6-sided structure. Juno utilizes high energy density Li ion
batteries for battery-regulated bus voltage.  Basic radiation
protection for sensitive electronics is afforded by a titanium-
walled vault.  Juno has a dual-mode propulsion system with a
deployable micrometeoroid sheild for the main engine.  Attitude
control thrusters are used for re-orienting the spin axis and for
smaller trajectory/orbit corrections, and spin-up/down manuevers.  The
thermal design uses a cold-biased passive design with software-
controlled heaters.  Attitude control is provided  using Inertial
Measurement Units, Stellar Reference Units, Spinning Sun Sensors, and
active (thrusters) and passive (fluid-filled loop) nutation damping.
Telecom is achieved with X-band uplink and downlink coupled with five
antennas for completed coverage and including tones capability for
critical low-link margin telemetry.  Ka-band telecom is included for
improved Doppler measurement performance.  Essential systems are
redundantt and cross-strapped.  The z-axis of the spacecraft coordinate
system is co-aligned with the HGA axis, hence, nominally points toward
Earth.  The spacecraft x-axis is in the direction of the solar panel which
includes the MAG boom at the end.  The y-axis completes a right-hand
orthogonal system.
 
 
SPACECRAFT SUBSYSTEMS
---------------------
 
The spacecraft comprised several subsystems, which are described briefly
below. For more detailed information, see JPLD-5564.
 
Structures and Mechanisms Subsystem
-------------------
 
The spacecraft structure uses heritage composite panel and clip
construction for decks, central cylinder, and gusset panels.
Polar mounted off-center spherical tanks are consistent with a spinning
spacecraft design with a high, stable inertia ratio.  The central
cylinder has high torsional stiffness.  Six gussets provide stiffness
for the solar arrays.  Components are located such that they meet all
mechanical requirements, including mass, field of view, magnetics, and
alignments.  The radiation vault uses titanium panels that provide
structure as well as shielding.  Assembly, Test, and Launch Operations
(ATLO) access is easily available through 3 removable panels (top and 2
sides).   The Telecom subassembly is contained on one panel.  Louvers
on the outside reject heat during Inner Cruise.  The vault also serves
as a Faraday cage.  Spacecraft mechanisms include solar array
articulation, providing up to 4.5 deg. of wing tilt, and allowing
approximately 1.9 deg. of principal axis adjustment.  A main engine
cover must open and close for each of 4 main engine burns as well as
main engine flushing burns, and also provides micrometeoroid protection.
Solar array wings consist of 11 solar panels and 1 MAG boom.  They use
heritage designs for (a) spring driven and viscously damped deployment,
and (b) a multi-panel retention and release.
 
 
 
Telecom Subsystem
-------------------------
 
The Gravity Science and Telecom Subsystem provides X-band command uplink
and engineering telemetry and science data downlink for the entire post-
launch, cruise, and Jupiter orbital operations at Earth ranges up to 6.5
AU.  The subsystem also provides for dual-band (X- and Ka-band) Doppler
tracking for Gravity Science at Jupiter (concurrent X-band telemetry
during Gravity Sciences passes also contributes to data return
requirements).  The subsystem is designed, built, and tested at JPL
prior to delivery to Lockheed Martin.
 
The non-science part of the subsystem is fully redundant.  The Ka-band
uplink for Gravity Science is single-string as is the Ka-band power
amplifier.  The subsystem is designed to provide a minimum 2-sigma
margin on all links.  Juno will normally use NASA&apos;s Deep Space Network
(DSN) 34-m subnet for communications.  The 70-m subnet will be used
for critical event coverage post launch, reception of tones during
main engine maneuvers (DSMs, JOI, and PRM), enhanced data return
during selected orbits at Jupiter, and for safe mode telecom.
 
The telecom design is sized to provide a minimum science downlink rate
of 18 kbps into a 34-m DSN station at max range (6.46 AU) during
orbital operations, and 12 kbps during Gravity Science perijove passes.
Higher data rates will be used at shorter ranges or with a 70-m DSN
station.  The design also supports sending tone modulation during DSMs,
JOI, and PRM burns when the spacecraft spin axis is nearly normal to
the Earth line.
 
Telecom equipment includes two Small Deep Space Transponders (SDSTs),
both with X/X and one with additional X/Ka capability.  The X/X/Ka
capability serves as a partial backup for Gravity Science.  There are
two 25-W X-band Traveling Wave Tube Amplifiers (TWTAs), 5 Waveguide
Transfer Switches (WTSes), 2 X-band diplexers, filters, microwave
components, waveguide, and cabling.  These are all used to feed 5
separate antennas.  The high-gain antenna (HGA) is a 2.5-m, shaped,
axially symmetric, Gregorian, dual-reflector antenna fed by a
dual-band, coaxial, corrugated feed.  The HGA supports uplink and
downlink at both X and (carrier-only) Ka-band.  There is an X-band
medium-gain antenna (MGA or F-MGA), foreward and aft low-gain
antennas (LGAs, specifically F-LGA and A-LGA), and toroidal
antenna (T-LGA) that provides coverage during the DSMs, JOI, and PRM
burns.  The toroidal antenna is also used briefly during cruise when
the Sun-Probe-Earth (SPE) angle is near 90 deg.
 
All antennas except the toroidal antenna are aligned with the
spacecraft Z axis, which will be aligned with the spin axis shortly
after launch using the adjustable solar array wing actuators. The HGA,
MGA, and foreward LGA are nearly co-boresighted (the MGA and LGAs are
slightly offset from the spin vector).  The aft LGA is used when
the spacecraft&apos;s trajectory goes inside of the Earth&apos;s orbit and the
SPE angle is greater than 110 deg.
 
The Ka-band Translator Subsystem (KaTS) receives a Ka-band uplink
through the HGA from the DSN (DSS-25) and coherently generates a
Ka-band downlink carrier signal and then amplifies the signal.  The
signal is then guided to the Ka-band feed of the HGA for the Gravity
Science two-way Ka-band Doppler signal.  The KaTS is provided by the
Italian Space Agency.
 
 
 
Propulsion Subsystem
---------------------------
 
Juno uses a dual-mode Propulsion Subsystem, with a biprop main engine
(ME) and monoprop Reaction Control System (RCS) thrusters.  The 12
thrusters are mounted on 4 Rocket Engine Modules (REMs), allow
translation and rotation about 3 axes, and provide some redundancy.
There are 8 lateral thrusters, canted away from X by 5 deg. along Y
and by 12.5 deg. along Z, and 4 axial thrusters, canted away from Z
by 10 deg. along Y.  6 equal-sized spherical propellant tanks contain
fuel (4 tanks) and oxidizer (2).  Biprop mode (N2O4/hydrazine) is
used for major maneuvers and flushing burns, and monoprop mode
(blowdown hydrazine) is used for spin-up and -down, precession,
active nutation damping, and most TCMs and OTMs.  The Leros-1b main
engine is well-characterized, and is fixed on the Z axis, pointing
aft.  Isolation valve ladders included in the pressurization system
eliminate propellant mixing concerns.  RCS thrusters are located to
minimize plume interactions.  The propellant tanks are sized
consistent with the planned delta-V budget, for the maximum
spacecraft mass that can be lifted by an Atlas V 551 to the required C3.
 
 
 
Electrical Power Subsystem (EPS)
--------------------------------
 
 
Juno&apos;s redundant, single fault tolerant Electrical Power Subsystem
manages the spacecraft power bus and distribution of power to payloads,
propulsion, heaters, mechanism motor actuators, NASA Standard Initiators
(NSIs), and avionics.  The Power Distribution and Drive Unit (PDDU)
monitors and manages the spacecraft power bus, manages the available
solar array power to meet the spacecraft load and battery state of
charge (SOC), and provides controlled power distribution.  The Pyro
Initiator Unit (PIU) includes a redundant, dual fault tolerant
Pyrotechnic Initiator Module (PIM).  Power generation is provided
by 3 solar arrays using current generation UTJ solar cells.  Two 55
A-hr Li ion batteries provide power when Juno is off-Sun or in
eclipse, and are tolerant of the Jupiter radiation environment.  The
power modes during Science Orbits are sized for either an MWR or a
GRAV orbit, and provide sufficient margin given the expected loads
during perijove science passes as well as DSN telecom passes.
Sufficient power and energy margins have also been demonstrated for
the Launch, DSMs, JOI, PRM, and deorbit burn mission events, as well
as safe mode near EOM.
 
 
Command and Data Handling Subsystem (C&amp;DH)
--------------------------
 
The C&amp;DH is based on two redundant, single fault tolerant boxes
developed for MRO.  Each C&amp;DH box includes a cPCI bus interconnected
to 3U cards (except the DTCI card which uses 6U format) and a
RAD750 flight processor with 256 MBytes of NVM flash memory and 128
MBytes of SFC DRAM local memory.  It provides 100 Mbps total
instrument throughput, more than enough for payload requirements.
32 Gbits (base 2, EOL) of science data storage (plus 8 Gbits for
EDAC) are available on the DTCI card, which has been demonstrated
to be sufficient for minimum and maximum science orbit downlink data
requirements, and representative stress cases that account for data
retransmission and prioritization.
 
 
Guidance, Naviation, and Control Subsystem (GN&amp;C)
-------------------------------------------
 
The Juno GN&amp;C Subsystem uses spin-stabilized control.  The launch
spin rate of 1.4 RPM is initiated by the launch vehicle upper stage
(and adjusted by the spacecraft after solar array deployment).  The
planned spin rate varies during the mission: 1 RPM for cruise, 2 RPM
for science operations, and 5 RPM for main engine maneuvers.  MWR and
GRAV orbits at Jupiter use 2 different spacecraft attitudes: spin
axis parallel to orbit normal for MWR orbits, and HGA Earth-pointed
for GRAV orbits.  Precession and spin control use balanced mode for
minimum delta-V, and are capable of unbalanced mode for lower fuel
use (although not planned to be used).  Active nutation damping
requires the Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs).  Delta-V maneuvers
using the RCS thrusters can be either turn-burn-turn (TBT), which
requires precession to turn to the desired attitude, or vector-mode
(Vect), in which thrust is provided in both axial and lateral
directions.  Main engine maneuvers require precession to point the
engine in the desired direction.  One of two Stellar Reference
Units (SRUs) and one of two Spinning Sun Sensors (SSSes) are
continuously powered (the SRU is turned off for ME burns, and both
SSSes are powered on during safe mode).  One of two IMUs is powered
for delta-V maneuvers, large precessions (larger than ~2.5 deg.),
active nutation damping, and spin control.
 
 
 
Temperature Control Subsystem (TCS)
-----------------------------
 
Juno&apos;s Thermal Control Subsystem uses a passive cold biased design
with heaters and louvers.  The core TCS consists of an insulated,
louvered electronics vault atop an insulated, heated propulsion module.
This design accommodates all mission thermal environments from
perihelion to orbital operations.  During cruise, while the spacecraft
is close to the Sun, the HGA is used as a heat shield to protect the
vault avionics.  Outside ~1.4 AU, the spacecraft pointing is
unrestricted, while inside ~1.4 AU Sun-pointing and off-Sun-pointing
are required.  Most instrument electronics are contained within the
radiation vault and are thermally managed as part of the vault TCS.
Science sensors are externally mounted to the deck and are individually
blanketed and heated to maintain individual temperature limits.
 
 
 
JUNO SCIENCE INSTRUMENTS
---------------------------
 
Juno&apos;s instrument complement includes Gravity Science using the X and Ka bands
to determine the structure of Jupiter&apos;s interior; magnetometer investigation
(MAG)  to study the magnetic dynamo and interior of Jupiter as well as to
explore the polar magnetosphere; and a microwave radiometer (MWR) experiment
covering 6 wavelengths between 1.3 and 50 cm to perform deep atmospheric
sounding and composition measurements.  The instrument complement also
includes a suite of fields and particle instruments to study the polar
magnetosphere and Jupiter&apos;s aurora.  This suite includes an energetic particle
detector (JEDI), a Jovian auroral (plasma) distributions experiment (JADE), a
radio and plasma wave instrument (Waves),  an ultraviolet spectrometer (UVS),
and an Jupiter infrared auroral mapping instrument (JIRAM).  The JunoCam is a
camera included for education and public outreach.  While this is not a
science instrument, we plan to capture the data and archive them in the PDS
along with the other mission data.  The MAG investigation consists of
redundant flux gate magnetometers (FGM) and co-located advanced stellar
compasses (ASC).  The ASCs are provided by the Danish Technical University
under an effort led by John Jorgenson. The SRU is used for low-light remote
sensing at visible wavelengths and as an in situ particle detector for high
energy particles.
 
Scott Bolton is the Juno Principal Investigator.  The Science Team members
responsible for the delivery and operation of the instruments are listed

  Instrument Host Overview - DSN
  ================================
Radio Science investigations utilized instrumentation with
elements both on the spacecraft and at the NASA Deep Space Network
(DSN).  Much of this was shared equipment, being used for routine
telecommunications as well as for Radio Science.
 
The Deep Space Network was a telecommunications facility managed by
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of
Technology for the U.S.  National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
 
The primary function of the DSN was to provide two-way communications
between the Earth and spacecraft exploring the solar system.  To carry
out this function the DSN was equipped with high-power transmitters,
low-noise amplifiers and receivers, and appropriate monitoring and
control systems.
 
The DSN consisted of three complexes situated at approximately equally
spaced longitudinal intervals around the globe at Goldstone (near
Barstow, California), Robledo (near Madrid, Spain), and Tidbinbilla
(near Canberra, Australia).  Two of the complexes were located in the
northern hemisphere while the third was in the southern hemisphere.
 
The network comprised four subnets, each of which included one antenna
at each complex.  The four subnets were defined according to the
properties of their respective antennas: 70-m diameter, standard 34-m
diameter, high-efficiency 34-m diameter, and 26-m diameter.
 
These DSN complexes, in conjunction with telecommunications subsystems
onboard planetary spacecraft, constituted the major elements of
instrumentation for radio science investigations.

All antennas except the toroidal antenna are aligned with the
spacecraft Z axis, which will be aligned with the spin axis shortly
after launch using the adjustable solar array wing actuators. The HGA,
MGA, and foreward LGA are nearly co-boresighted (the MGA and LGAs are
slightly offset from the spin vector).  The aft LGA is used when
the spacecraft&apos;s trajectory goes inside of the Earth&apos;s orbit and the
SPE angle is greater than 110 deg.
 
The Ka-band Translator Subsystem (KaTS) receives a Ka-band uplink
through the HGA from the DSN (DSS-25) and coherently generates a
Ka-band downlink carrier signal and then amplifies the signal.  The
signal is then guided to the Ka-band feed of the HGA for the Gravity
Science two-way Ka-band Doppler signal.  The KaTS is provided by the
Italian Space Agency.
 
 
 
Propulsion Subsystem
---------------------------
 
Juno uses a dual-mode Propulsion Subsystem, with a biprop main engine
(ME) and monoprop Reaction Control System (RCS) thrusters.  The 12
thrusters are mounted on 4 Rocket Engine Modules (REMs), allow
translation and rotation about 3 axes, and provide some redundancy.
There are 8 lateral thrusters, canted away from X by 5 deg. along Y
and by 12.5 deg. along Z, and 4 axial thrusters, canted away from Z
by 10 deg. along Y.  6 equal-sized spherical propellant tanks contain
fuel (4 tanks) and oxidizer (2).  Biprop mode (N2O4/hydrazine) is
used for major maneuvers and flushing burns, and monoprop mode
(blowdown hydrazine) is used for spin-up and -down, precession,
active nutation damping, and most TCMs and OTMs.  The Leros-1b main
engine is well-characterized, and is fixed on the Z axis, pointing
aft.  Isolation valve ladders included in the pressurization system
eliminate propellant mixing concerns.  RCS thrusters are located to
minimize plume interactions.  The propellant tanks are sized
consistent with the planned delta-V budget, for the maximum
spacecraft mass that can be lifted by an Atlas V 551 to the required C3.
 
 
 
Electrical Power Subsystem (EPS)
--------------------------------
 
 
Juno&apos;s redundant, single fault tolerant Electrical Power Subsystem
manages the spacecraft power bus and distribution of power to payloads,
propulsion, heaters, mechanism motor actuators, NASA Standard Initiators
(NSIs), and avionics.  The Power Distribution and Drive Unit (PDDU)
monitors and manages the spacecraft power bus, manages the available
solar array power to meet the spacecraft load and battery state of
charge (SOC), and provides controlled power distribution.  The Pyro
Initiator Unit (PIU) includes a redundant, dual fault tolerant
Pyrotechnic Initiator Module (PIM).  Power generation is provided
by 3 solar arrays using current generation UTJ solar cells.  Two 55
A-hr Li ion batteries provide power when Juno is off-Sun or in
eclipse, and are tolerant of the Jupiter radiation environment.  The
power modes during Science Orbits are sized for either an MWR or a
GRAV orbit, and provide sufficient margin given the expected loads
during perijove science passes as well as DSN telecom passes.
Sufficient power and energy margins have also been demonstrated for
the Launch, DSMs, JOI, PRM, and deorbit burn mission events, as well
as safe mode near EOM.
 
 
Command and Data Handling Subsystem (C&amp;DH)
--------------------------
 
The C&amp;DH is based on two redundant, single fault tolerant boxes
developed for MRO.  Each C&amp;DH box includes a cPCI bus interconnected
to 3U cards (except the DTCI card which uses 6U format) and a
RAD750 flight processor with 256 MBytes of NVM flash memory and 128
MBytes of SFC DRAM local memory.  It provides 100 Mbps total
instrument throughput, more than enough for payload requirements.
32 Gbits (base 2, EOL) of science data storage (plus 8 Gbits for
EDAC) are available on the DTCI card, which has been demonstrated
to be sufficient for minimum and maximum science orbit downlink data
requirements, and representative stress cases that account for data
retransmission and prioritization.
 
 
Guidance, Naviation, and Control Subsystem (GN&amp;C)
-------------------------------------------
 
The Juno GN&amp;C Subsystem uses spin-stabilized control.  The launch
spin rate of 1.4 RPM is initiated by the launch vehicle upper stage
(and adjusted by the spacecraft after solar array deployment).  The
planned spin rate varies during the mission: 1 RPM for cruise, 2 RPM
for science operations, and 5 RPM for main engine maneuvers.  MWR and
GRAV orbits at Jupiter use 2 different spacecraft attitudes: spin
axis parallel to orbit normal for MWR orbits, and HGA Earth-pointed
for GRAV orbits.  Precession and spin control use balanced mode for
minimum delta-V, and are capable of unbalanced mode for lower fuel
use (although not planned to be used).  Active nutation damping
requires the Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs).  Delta-V maneuvers
using the RCS thrusters can be either turn-burn-turn (TBT), which
requires precession to turn to the desired attitude, or vector-mode
(Vect), in which thrust is provided in both axial and lateral
directions.  Main engine maneuvers require precession to point the
engine in the desired direction.  One of two Stellar Reference
Units (SRUs) and one of two Spinning Sun Sensors (SSSes) are
continuously powered (the SRU is turned off for ME burns, and both
SSSes are powered on during safe mode).  One of two IMUs is powered
for delta-V maneuvers, large precessions (larger than ~2.5 deg.),
active nutation damping, and spin control.
 
 
 
Temperature Control Subsystem (TCS)
-----------------------------
 
Juno&apos;s Thermal Control Subsystem uses a passive cold biased design
with heaters and louvers.  The core TCS consists of an insulated,
louvered electronics vault atop an insulated, heated propulsion module.
This design accommodates all mission thermal environments from
perihelion to orbital operations.  During cruise, while the spacecraft
is close to the Sun, the HGA is used as a heat shield to protect the
vault avionics.  Outside ~1.4 AU, the spacecraft pointing is
unrestricted, while inside ~1.4 AU Sun-pointing and off-Sun-pointing
are required.  Most instrument electronics are contained within the
radiation vault and are thermally managed as part of the vault TCS.
Science sensors are externally mounted to the deck and are individually
blanketed and heated to maintain individual temperature limits.
 
 
 
JUNO SCIENCE INSTRUMENTS
---------------------------
 
Juno&apos;s instrument complement includes Gravity Science using the X and Ka bands
to determine the structure of Jupiter&apos;s interior; magnetometer investigation
(MAG)  to study the magnetic dynamo and interior of Jupiter as well as to
explore the polar magnetosphere; and a microwave radiometer (MWR) experiment
covering 6 wavelengths between 1.3 and 50 cm to perform deep atmospheric
sounding and composition measurements.  The instrument complement also
includes a suite of fields and particle instruments to study the polar
magnetosphere and Jupiter&apos;s aurora.  This suite includes an energetic particle
detector (JEDI), a Jovian auroral (plasma) distributions experiment (JADE), a
radio and plasma wave instrument (Waves),  an ultraviolet spectrometer (UVS),
and an Jupiter infrared auroral mapping instrument (JIRAM).  The JunoCam is a
camera included for education and public outreach.  While this is not a
science instrument, we plan to capture the data and archive them in the PDS
along with the other mission data.  The MAG investigation consists of
redundant flux gate magnetometers (FGM) and co-located advanced stellar
compasses (ASC).  The ASCs are provided by the Danish Technical University
under an effort led by John Jorgenson. The SRU is used for low-light remote
sensing at visible wavelengths and as an in situ particle detector for high
energy particles.
 
Scott Bolton is the Juno Principal Investigator.  The Science Team members

  Instrument Host Overview - DSN
  ================================
Radio Science investigations utilized instrumentation with
elements both on the spacecraft and at the NASA Deep Space Network
(DSN).  Much of this was shared equipment, being used for routine
telecommunications as well as for Radio Science.
 
The Deep Space Network was a telecommunications facility managed by
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of
Technology for the U.S.  National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
 
The primary function of the DSN was to provide two-way communications
between the Earth and spacecraft exploring the solar system.  To carry
out this function the DSN was equipped with high-power transmitters,
low-noise amplifiers and receivers, and appropriate monitoring and
control systems.
 
The DSN consisted of three complexes situated at approximately equally
spaced longitudinal intervals around the globe at Goldstone (near
Barstow, California), Robledo (near Madrid, Spain), and Tidbinbilla
(near Canberra, Australia).  Two of the complexes were located in the
northern hemisphere while the third was in the southern hemisphere.
 
The network comprised four subnets, each of which included one antenna
at each complex.  The four subnets were defined according to the
properties of their respective antennas: 70-m diameter, standard 34-m
diameter, high-efficiency 34-m diameter, and 26-m diameter.
 
These DSN complexes, in conjunction with telecommunications subsystems
onboard planetary spacecraft, constituted the major elements of
instrumentation for radio science investigations.

<field name="description">Instrument Overview
===================

The Juno Stellar Reference Unit (SRU) is a custom built star sensor 
manufactured by Selex Galileo (now Leonardo Finmeccanica) in Florence, Italy. 
The SRU provides inertial attitude information to Juno&apos;s attitude 
determination software by producing vector measurements of star-like objects 
observed within its field of view (St. Pierre et al., 2012). The SRU 
optical heads are mounted on the forward deck of the Juno spacecraft. Only 
one SRU is operated at any given time. SRU-1 is the nominal operational unit, 
and SRU-2 provides cold spare redundancy. The SRU may also be operated in a
snapshot mode which allows collection of full or partial images by the 
silicon charge coupled device (CCD) focal plane array.

Juno&apos;s SRU Team operates the SRU as a broadband visible (450-1100 nm) 
science imager for the purpose of studying low-light features and phenomena 
of the Jovian system, such as Jupiter&apos;s faint dust ring and auroral 
emissions. SRU images of lightning on Jupiter&apos;s dark side (Becker et al., 
2020) support Juno&apos;s study of Jupiter&apos;s atmospheric dynamics and 
composition, and images of Jupiter&apos;s moons under low illumination 
conditions support Juno&apos;s satellite science.

The Radiation Monitoring Investigation (RMI) of the Juno mission was designed 
to characterize the external Jovian radiation environment using the 
Stellar Reference Unit (SRU) and other instruments on the spacecraft (Becker 
et al., 2017). Juno&apos;s RMI (a component of the SRU Team) measures noise from
penetrating electrons within SRU images collected at Jupiter specifically 
for this purpose. Noise signals are created by ionization events within the 
active regions of the SRU focal plane array pixels as penetrating charged 
particles pass through the material. The objective is to characterize 
Jupiter&apos;s &gt;10 MeV electron environment within regions of the jovian 
magnetosphere where little to no in situ high energy electron data have 
previously been collected.


Detailed instrument description
===============================

The Juno Stellar Reference Unit (SRU) is a low-light, broadband visible 
(450-1100 nm) imager with no filters. The camera has a 29.924 mm focal 
length, spatial resolution of 0.57 mrad per pixel, and a 16.4 deg (square) 
field of view. The collecting area of the optics is 4.155 cm2. The SRU 
detector is a frame transfer silicon CCD with a 512x512 pixel useful 
imaging region, a 512x512 pixel light shielded storage region, 17 micron 
pixel pitch, and a 200,000 electron full well capacity (Becker et al., 
2005). The camera gain is 15.47 signal electrons per output analog-to-digital 
data number (DN). The throughput of the optical system, QT (the CCD 
quantum efficiency (Q) multiplied by the optics transmission (T)), is 
provided as a function of wavelength in Appendix C of the Software Interface 
Specification (SIS). 

Because the SRU must perform the star measurement function within the 
extremely harsh radiation environment of Jupiter&apos;s magnetosphere its optical 
head is very heavily shielded in order to reduce noise from penetrating 
ionizing radiation. The CCD registers impacts by penetrating charged particles 
as elevated noise signals within a cluster of pixels local to each &apos;hit.&apos; The 
noise signal electrons are created by ionization events within the active 
depletion and diffusion regions of the pixels as charged particles pass 
through the silicon. Given the heavy shielding of the SRU optical head, only 
external electrons &gt;1 MeV are energetic enough to generate noise in the CCD 
with significant probability, either as an impacting primary electron of 
reduced energy, or by virtue of a secondary particle generated during the 
transit into the optical head materials. Although there is a probability for 
external 1 to 10 MeV electrons to generate noise in the SRU CCD, penetrating 
&gt;10-MeV electrons should be the dominant contributors to CCD noise events in 
the Juno SRU at Jupiter. This is primarily due to the spectral hardness of the 
Jovian electron distribution, such that penetrating &gt;10-MeV electrons will be 
the dominant contributors to CCD noise events (Becker et al., 2017). 

As Juno is a spin-stabilized spacecraft, the SRU CCD is nominally operated 
using time delay integration (TDI) to compensate for the motion of the ~two 
revolutions per minute (RPM) spacecraft spin. Without TDI, the spacecraft spin 
causes the scene to move along the CCD column direction. When operated using 
TDI, the rows of the image are shifted during the exposure time at an angular 
rate consistent with the spacecraft spin. A typical spin rate of 2 RPM (12 
degrees per second) results in a 2.7 ms integration dwell time between shifts. 
This integration time is calculated by the SRU based on the angular rate 
information provided by the spacecraft. During TDI exposure, the first rows of 
the image are shifted into the optically shielded storage region and are no 
longer exposed to light; however, the pixels in the storage region continue to 
be exposed to impacts from penetrating radiation. The number of TDI shifts is 
a function of the desired exposure time. Post-exposure, the transfer of the 
image to the storage region occurs over a period of (526 - Number of TDI 
shifts during exposure) x 2 usec. Pixels are then read out at a rate of 1 us 
per pixel; the time to read out a full row of the CCD image is approximately 
0.51 ms. The fact that the CCD is read out in a row-wise fashion following 
transfer into the storage region creates an effective range of exposures to 
penetrators on a single frame which adds to the measurement capability.  For 
example, this range is 1:25 for 10 ms exposures given the ~250 ms readout 
time for a full frame image. 

When operated in a &apos;no-TDI&apos; mode, the pixels in the image region are exposed 
to photons without undergoing any row shifts during the exposure time. This 
causes the scene to smear along the CCD column direction at a rate equal to 
the spacecraft angular spin rate. Frame transfer and readout occurs in the 
same fashion as with TDI images. 

The measurement dynamic range of the SRU&apos;s particle detection algorithm was 
determined to be 200 - 10 million counts cm^-2 CCD s^-1. Measured count rates 
agreed with simulated expectations to within 20%. See Becker et al. (2017) for 
further details.

<field name="data_set_description">Data Set Overview
    =================

    This data set contains images acquired by Juno&apos;s Stellar Reference 
    Unit (SRU).

    This data set uses the Committee on Data Management
    and Computation (CODMAC) data level numbering system.
    The SRU EDRs are considered Level 2 or Edited Data
    (equivalent to NASA Level 0). 


    Processing
    ==========

    SRU products are produced by the program 
        make_PDS_labels_SRU_EDR.pl .
    This program converts the FITS images from
    the format internally used by the Juno SRU Team.
    This program reads an SRU image file, strips the FITS headers, extracts
    information from those headers, creates and formats the PDS labels, 
    and creates a stripped image file.


    Data
    ====

    SRU images are a standard size of 512 by 512 pixels (numbered from 0 
    through 511, inclusive). The last two rows, rows 510 and 511, 
    are &apos;dummy&apos; rows, and the first two columns, columns 0 and 1, are dummy 
    columns. Thus the first pixel of real data is indexed at (row, column) 
    0, 2. When the SRU is operated using time delay integration (TDI), the 
    first row of real data (row 2) experiences an 8.1 ms exposure to the 
    optical scene (2 RPM spacecraft spin rate; see section 5.1 of the SIS).
    The SRU (instrument) frame has a boresight coordinate (255.5, 255.5).
   
    Pixel values in the EDRs are in units of output 
    analog-to-digital data number (DN). Pixel values are represented as 
    16 bit signed integers 
    with values from 0 to 16383 (2^14-1), inclusive. The SRU data only 
    occupies 14 bits, so higher order bits are always zero.
    Dummy pixels are not read out and their values are replaced with zero. 
    Any pixel with a zero value is not a valid measurement. Electronic 
    offsets cause minimum valid values to be on-zero, on the order of 550 
    or 680 DN, depending on the utilized SRU, 1 or 2 respectively.

    SRU EDR images are not compressed or processed geometrically and are 
    archived in the standard Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) format 
    (http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/) (Wells et al., 1981). Each image product 
    has two parts: the image itself with the extension of &apos;FIT&apos; and a 
    detached label with an extension of &apos;LBL&apos;. Image files include a 
    standard FITS header that is 2880 bytes long. Files are then padded 
    with zero fill (ASCII 00h) to be a multiple of 2880 bytes long, as is 
    standard for FITS files.

    Partial images are the result of one of two situations: 1.) They may 
    be commanded purposely in order to satisfy onboard command timing 
    restrictions, or 2.) Data downlink or data collection problems such as 
    outages of the Deep Space Network (DSN), spacecraft anomalies, or data 
    gaps due to weather. In either case, the EDR images are padded with 
    zeros to always be the same 512x512 pixel size. 

    Refer to the Stellar Reference Unit Standard Data Products Software 
    Interface Specification (SIS) for further details on these data products
    and corrections which can be made for camera optical distortion.</field>

Mission Overview
================

  Prime Mission
  -------------
  Juno launched on August 5, 2011. The spacecraft used a delta V - EGA
  trajectory consisting of deep space maneuvers on August 30, and September
  14, 2012 followed by an Earth gravity assist on 9 October 2013 at an
  altitude of ~500 km. Juno arrived at Jupiter in July 2016 using a 53.5-day
  capture orbit prior to commencing operations for a prime mission comprising
  32 high inclination, high eccentricity orbits of Jupiter.  The orbit is
  polar (~90deg inclination) with a periapsis altitude of ~4,500 km and a
  semi-major axis of ~57 RJ giving an orbital period of about 53 days.
  Data were not acquired during Jupiter Orbit Insertion (Perijove 0) nor
  during Perijove 2. 

  The primary science is acquired during a period of several hours centered
  on each periapsis although fields and particles data are acquired at
  generally lower rates for the remaining apoapsis portion of each orbit.
  Some of the periapses are dedicated to microwave radiometry of Jupiter&apos;s
  deep atmosphere by turning the spin axis of Juno so as to optimize the
  microwave radiometry field of view on Jupiter with other orbits optimized
  for gravity measurements to determine the structure of Jupiter&apos;s interior.
  All orbits include fields and particles measurements of the planet&apos;s auroral
  regions. 

  Juno is spin stabilized with a rotation rate of ~2 revolutions per minute
  (RPM). For the radiometry orbits the spin axis is precisely perpendicular to
  the orbit plane so that the radiometer fields of view pass through the
  nadir.  For gravity passes, the spin axis is aligned to the Earth direction,
  allowing for Doppler measurements through the periapsis portion of the 
  orbit.  Provision is made for a tilted attitude between these two when the
  radiometry tilt exceeds the allowable off-sun angle for power 
  considerations. The orbit plane is initially very close to perpendicular to
  the Sun-Jupiter line and evolves over the mission. The apoapsis passes
  through the anti-sunward direction, but a modest inclination change was used
  to avoid an umbral eclipse. Data acquired during the periapsis passes are
  recorded and played back over the subsequent apoapsis portion of the orbit.

  Extended Mission
  ----------------
  The extended mission adds an additional 40 orbits (76 orbits total) to 
  continue the orbital tour through September 2025.  The orbital period at 
  the beginning of the extended mission is ~43 days and is reduced by a close 
  flyby of Europa at orbit 45 in the fall of 2022 to ~38 days and further 
  reduced by two close flybys of Io at orbit 57 and 58 in early 2024 to ~33 
  days. Juno&apos;s northward perijove precession reduces the altitude over 
  Jupiter&apos;s northern hemisphere and enables close flybys of Ganymede, Europa, 
  Io and Jupiter&apos;s ring system as well as the study of Jupiter&apos;s northern 
  hemisphere. The longitude of the perijoves is controlled only through orbit 
  58. After Io, the mapping of the magnetic and gravity field is no longer 
  controlled via orbital maneuvers.   During the extended mission, the 
  perijove local time rotates from about 9 hours at perijove 35 to about 2 
  hours. The latitude of perijove continues to precess from about 29 degrees 
  north on perijove 35 to about 64 degrees north.

  Extended Mission Instrumentation
  ---------------
  Juno&apos;s instrument complement includes Gravity Science using the X- and 
  Ka-bands to determine the structure of Jupiter&apos;s interior; vector fluxgate
  magnetometer (MAG) to study the magnetic dynamo and interior of Jupiter as
  well as to explore the polar magnetosphere; and a microwave radiometer (MWR)
  experiment covering 6 wavelengths between 1.3 and 50 cm to perform deep
  atmospheric sounding and composition measurements. The MAG investigation
  includes Advanced Stellar Compasses (ASCs) mounted on optical benches
  including the fluxgate magnetometers (FGMs) in order to directly provide
  attitude information that does not rely on understanding how the solar
  panel inboard of the MAG boom flexes. The ASCs can provide some imaging of
  various non-stellar objects to enhance science or to provide outreach
  images.

  The instrument complement also includes a suite of fields and particle
  instruments to study the polar magnetosphere and Jupiter&apos;s aurora. This 
  suite includes an energetic particle detector (JEDI), a Jovian auroral
  (plasma) distributions experiment (JADE), a radio and plasma wave instrument
  (Waves), an ultraviolet spectrometer (UVS), and a Jupiter infrared auroral
  mapping instrument (JIRAM). During the extended mission, the Stellar
  Reference Unit (SRU) can image Jupiter&apos;s ring system, lightning, satellites
  and auroras as well as record radiation noise.  The JunoCam is a camera 
  included for education and public outreach and can provide images of 
  Jupiter&apos;s atmosphere, satellites and rings.  During the EM, the data are 
  archived in the PDS along with the other mission data.

Mission Phases
==============

  LAUNCH
  ------
    The Launch phase starts at L-40 min (Launch-40 min), and covers the
    interval from launch, through initial ground station acquisition, until
    the establishment of a pre-defined, stable, and slowly changing Sun-
    pointed attitude when cruise attitude control algorithms and ephemerides
    can be used. The end of the Launch phase is determined by post-launch
    health and safety assessments.  The boundary is at L+3 days, after initial
    acquisition and after confirmation that the Flight System is safe and in
    a power-positive, thermally stable, and commandable attitude.

    Target Name              :  N/A
    Mission Phase Start Time :  2011-08-05 (2011-217)
    Mission Phase Stop Time  :  2011-08-08 (2011-220)


  INNER CRUISE 1
  --------------
    The Inner Cruise 1 phase lasts from post-Launch establishment of a pre-
    defined and stable Sun-pointed attitude when cruise attitude control
    algorithms and ephemerides can be used, until after initial spacecraft and
    instrument checkouts have been performed and the spacecraft has gotten far
    enough from the Sun to allow Earth-pointing instead of Sun-pointing. TCM 1
    (the first planned trajectory correction maneuver) was deemed not 
    necessary, hence, was not executed.  The phase spans the interval from L+3
    to L+66 days.

    Target Name              :  SOLAR_SYSTEM
    Mission Phase Start Time :  2011-08-08 (2011-220)
    Mission Phase Stop Time  :  2011-10-10 (2011-283)


  INNER CRUISE 2
  --------------
    The Inner Cruise 2 phase spans the period from L+66 days until L+663
    days.  The Deep Space Maneuvers (DSMs) occur during this phase, near
    aphelion of Juno&apos;s first orbit about the Sun, on the way to Earth Flyby
    and then Jupiter.  There is increased DSN (Deep Space Network) coverage
    associated with the DSMs and a cleanup TCM. DSMs 1 and 2 occur on 
    2012-08-30 and 2010-09-14.

    Target Name              :  SOLAR_SYSTEM
    Mission Phase Start Time :  2011-10-10 (2011-283)
    Mission Phase Stop Time  :  2013-05-29 (2013-149)


  INNER CRUISE 3
  --------------
    The Inner Cruise 3 phase spans the interval from L+663 days to L+823
    days.  The duration of this cruise phase is 160 days.  Featured in this
    phase is Earth Flyby (EFB), which gives Juno a gravity assist (providing
    7.3 km/s of deltaV) on its way to Jupiter. It occurs as the spacecraft is
    completing one elliptical orbit around the Sun and includes perihelion.
    Three TCMs were planned before EFB (the last of which was deemed not
    necessary) and one after EFB. There is increased DSN coverage associated
    with the 4 maneuvers and EFB.  The Inner Cruise 3 phase is focused on
    performing the required maneuvers, as well as an integrated operations
    exercise around Earth Flyby, subject to Flight System constraints.
    Closest approach to Earth occurs on 2013-10-09 at 19:21 UTC.

    Target Name              :  EARTH, SOLAR_SYSTEM
    Mission Phase Start Time :  2013-05-29 (2013-149)
    Mission Phase Stop Time  :  2013-11-05 (2013-309)

    Earth Closest Approach   :  2013-10-09T19:21 (2013-282)


  OUTER CRUISE
  ------------
    The Outer Cruise phase lasts from L+823 days until the start of Jupiter
    Approach at Jupiter Orbit Insertion (JOI)-6 months (JOI-182 days or
    L+1614 days). The duration of this cruise phase is 791 days, which is
    over 2 years.

    Target Name              :  SOLAR_SYSTEM
    Mission Phase Start Time :  2013-11-05 (2013-309)
    Mission Phase Stop Time  :  2016-01-05 (2016-005)


  JUPITER APPROACH
  ----------------
    The Jupiter Approach phase lasts the final 6 months of cruise before
    Jupiter Orbit Insertion and is an opportunity for final Flight System and
    instrument checkouts as well as science observations to start exercising
    the ground system and Flight System, although orbit insertion preparations
    limit instrument activities close to JOI. There are more frequent
    maneuvers approaching JOI, starting with a TCM at JOI-5 months, and
    correspondingly increasing DSN coverage. The 178-day Jupiter Approach
    phase is preceded by a 26-month Outer Cruise phase.   Jupiter Approach
    starts 3 months after the project is fully staffed up in preparation for
    JOI and the 1.3 years of science orbits.   The phase ends at JOI-4 days,
    which is the start of the JOI critical sequence.

    Target Name:             :  JUPITER, SOLAR_SYSTEM
    Mission Phase Start Time :  2016-01-05 (2016-005)
    Mission Phase Stop Time  :  2016-07-01 (2016-183)


  JUPITER ORBIT INSERTION
  -----------------------
    The JOI phase encompasses the JOI critical sequence. It begins 4 days
    before the start of the orbit insertion maneuver and ends 1 hour after the
    start.  JOI, the second critical event of the mission, occurs at closest
    approach to Jupiter, and slows the spacecraft enough to let it be captured
    by Jupiter into a 53.8-day orbit.  A cleanup burn at JOI+8.6d during the
    Capture Orbits phase is required to clean up JOI maneuver execution
    errors. DSN coverage is continuous during the JOI phase.

    Perijove 0               :  2016-07-05T02:47:32 (2016-187)    


  PRIME MISSION
  --------------
    The Science Orbits phase includes Orbit 0 through Orbit 35.  Orbit N is
    defined from apojove (AJ) N-1 through apojove N, and includes perijove
    (PJ) N.  Orbit numbering starts before the Science Orbits phase.  JOI
    occurs at PJ0, so Orbit 0 lasts from PJ0 through AJ0 (including a JOI 
    cleanup maneuver at JOI+8.6d).  Orbit 1 includes PJ1, and runs from AJ0
    through AJ1. Orbit 2 includes PJ2, and runs from AJ1 through AJ2. Orbit
    3 includes PJ3, and runs from AJ2 through AJ3. Early orbital science was
    baselined in Orbits 0, 1, 2, and 3, except for the JOI keepout zone.
    Orbit 4 is the first science orbit. It includes PJ4 (and the first OTM at 
    PJ4+7.5h), and runs from AJ3 through AJ4.  The flyby of Ganymede (PJ34)
    reduced the orbital period from about 53 days to about 43 days.  Small
    (up to 8 m/s) orbit trim maneuvers (OTMs) are planned after each set of 
    perijove science observations, at PJ+4h, PJ+6h, or PJ+7.5h in Orbits 4
    through 34, to target the perijove longitude required for science
    observations in the next orbit. 

    Radiation accumulation increases substantially as the orbital line of
    apsides rotates and perijove latitude increases from 3 degrees at JOI to
    36 (TBD) degrees at PJ35.

  EXTENDED MISSION
  ----------------
  Using the same orbit numbering scheme as in the Prime Mission, the Extended
  Mission begins on 1 August 2021 and extends to orbit 76, through September 
  2025.  The Extended Mission includes a close Europa flyby during orbit 45
  which reduces the orbital period to about 38 days. Close flybys of Io
  occur on orbits 57 and 58, reducing the period to about 33 days. Note that
  times are from the reference trajectory and are not be be construed as 
  as-flown, reconstructed times.

Mission Overview
================

  Prime Mission
  -------------
  Juno launched on August 5, 2011. The spacecraft used a delta V - EGA
  trajectory consisting of deep space maneuvers on August 30, and September
  14, 2012 followed by an Earth gravity assist on 9 October 2013 at an
  altitude of ~500 km. Juno arrived at Jupiter in July 2016 using a 53.5-day
  capture orbit prior to commencing operations for a prime mission comprising
  32 high inclination, high eccentricity orbits of Jupiter.  The orbit is
  polar (~90deg inclination) with a periapsis altitude of ~4,500 km and a
  semi-major axis of ~57 RJ giving an orbital period of about 53 days.
  Data were not acquired during Jupiter Orbit Insertion (Perijove 0) nor
  during Perijove 2. 

  The primary science is acquired during a period of several hours centered
  on each periapsis although fields and particles data are acquired at
  generally lower rates for the remaining apoapsis portion of each orbit.
  Some of the periapses are dedicated to microwave radiometry of Jupiter&apos;s
  deep atmosphere by turning the spin axis of Juno so as to optimize the
  microwave radiometry field of view on Jupiter with other orbits optimized
  for gravity measurements to determine the structure of Jupiter&apos;s interior.
  All orbits include fields and particles measurements of the planet&apos;s auroral
  regions. 

  Juno is spin stabilized with a rotation rate of ~2 revolutions per minute
  (RPM). For the radiometry orbits the spin axis is precisely perpendicular to
  the orbit plane so that the radiometer fields of view pass through the
  nadir.  For gravity passes, the spin axis is aligned to the Earth direction,
  allowing for Doppler measurements through the periapsis portion of the 
  orbit.  Provision is made for a tilted attitude between these two when the
  radiometry tilt exceeds the allowable off-sun angle for power 
  considerations. The orbit plane is initially very close to perpendicular to
  the Sun-Jupiter line and evolves over the mission. The apoapsis passes
  through the anti-sunward direction, but a modest inclination change was used
  to avoid an umbral eclipse. Data acquired during the periapsis passes are
  recorded and played back over the subsequent apoapsis portion of the orbit.

  Extended Mission
  ----------------
  The extended mission adds an additional 40 orbits (76 orbits total) to 
  continue the orbital tour through September 2025.  The orbital period at 
  the beginning of the extended mission is ~43 days and is reduced by a close 
  flyby of Europa at orbit 45 in the fall of 2022 to ~38 days and further 
  reduced by two close flybys of Io at orbit 57 and 58 in early 2024 to ~33 
  days. Juno&apos;s northward perijove precession reduces the altitude over 
  Jupiter&apos;s northern hemisphere and enables close flybys of Ganymede, Europa, 
  Io and Jupiter&apos;s ring system as well as the study of Jupiter&apos;s northern 
  hemisphere. The longitude of the perijoves is controlled only through orbit 
  58. After Io, the mapping of the magnetic and gravity field is no longer 
  controlled via orbital maneuvers.   During the extended mission, the 
  perijove local time rotates from about 9 hours at perijove 35 to about 2 
  hours. The latitude of perijove continues to precess from about 29 degrees 
  north on perijove 35 to about 64 degrees north.

  Extended Mission Instrumentation
  ---------------
  Juno&apos;s instrument complement includes Gravity Science using the X- and 
  Ka-bands to determine the structure of Jupiter&apos;s interior; vector fluxgate
  magnetometer (MAG) to study the magnetic dynamo and interior of Jupiter as
  well as to explore the polar magnetosphere; and a microwave radiometer (MWR)
  experiment covering 6 wavelengths between 1.3 and 50 cm to perform deep
  atmospheric sounding and composition measurements. The MAG investigation
  includes Advanced Stellar Compasses (ASCs) mounted on optical benches
  including the fluxgate magnetometers (FGMs) in order to directly provide
  attitude information that does not rely on understanding how the solar
  panel inboard of the MAG boom flexes. The ASCs can provide some imaging of
  various non-stellar objects to enhance science or to provide outreach
  images.

  The instrument complement also includes a suite of fields and particle
  instruments to study the polar magnetosphere and Jupiter&apos;s aurora. This 
  suite includes an energetic particle detector (JEDI), a Jovian auroral
  (plasma) distributions experiment (JADE), a radio and plasma wave instrument
  (Waves), an ultraviolet spectrometer (UVS), and a Jupiter infrared auroral
  mapping instrument (JIRAM). During the extended mission, the Stellar
  Reference Unit (SRU) can image Jupiter&apos;s ring system, lightning, satellites
  and auroras as well as record radiation noise.  The JunoCam is a camera 
  included for education and public outreach and can provide images of 
  Jupiter&apos;s atmosphere, satellites and rings.  During the EM, the data are 
  archived in the PDS along with the other mission data.

Mission Phases
==============

  LAUNCH
  ------
    The Launch phase starts at L-40 min (Launch-40 min), and covers the
    interval from launch, through initial ground station acquisition, until
    the establishment of a pre-defined, stable, and slowly changing Sun-
    pointed attitude when cruise attitude control algorithms and ephemerides
    can be used. The end of the Launch phase is determined by post-launch
    health and safety assessments.  The boundary is at L+3 days, after initial
    acquisition and after confirmation that the Flight System is safe and in
    a power-positive, thermally stable, and commandable attitude.

    Mission Phase Start Time :  2011-08-05 (2011-217)
    Mission Phase Stop Time  :  2011-08-08 (2011-220)


  INNER CRUISE 1
  --------------
    The Inner Cruise 1 phase lasts from post-Launch establishment of a pre-
    defined and stable Sun-pointed attitude when cruise attitude control
    algorithms and ephemerides can be used, until after initial spacecraft and
    instrument checkouts have been performed and the spacecraft has gotten far
    enough from the Sun to allow Earth-pointing instead of Sun-pointing. TCM 1
    (the first planned trajectory correction maneuver) was deemed not 
    necessary, hence, was not executed.  The phase spans the interval from L+3
    to L+66 days.

    Mission Phase Stop Time  :  2011-10-10 (2011-283)


  INNER CRUISE 2
  --------------
    The Inner Cruise 2 phase spans the period from L+66 days until L+663
    days.  The Deep Space Maneuvers (DSMs) occur during this phase, near
    aphelion of Juno&apos;s first orbit about the Sun, on the way to Earth Flyby
    and then Jupiter.  There is increased DSN (Deep Space Network) coverage
    associated with the DSMs and a cleanup TCM. DSMs 1 and 2 occur on 
    2012-08-30 and 2010-09-14.

    Target Name              :  SOLAR_SYSTEM
    Mission Phase Start Time :  2011-10-10 (2011-283)
    Mission Phase Stop Time  :  2013-05-29 (2013-149)


  INNER CRUISE 3
  --------------
    The Inner Cruise 3 phase spans the interval from L+663 days to L+823
    days.  The duration of this cruise phase is 160 days.  Featured in this
    phase is Earth Flyby (EFB), which gives Juno a gravity assist (providing
    7.3 km/s of deltaV) on its way to Jupiter. It occurs as the spacecraft is
    completing one elliptical orbit around the Sun and includes perihelion.
    Three TCMs were planned before EFB (the last of which was deemed not
    necessary) and one after EFB. There is increased DSN coverage associated
    with the 4 maneuvers and EFB.  The Inner Cruise 3 phase is focused on
    performing the required maneuvers, as well as an integrated operations
    exercise around Earth Flyby, subject to Flight System constraints.
    Closest approach to Earth occurs on 2013-10-09 at 19:21 UTC.

  OUTER CRUISE
  ------------
    The Outer Cruise phase lasts from L+823 days until the start of Jupiter
    Approach at Jupiter Orbit Insertion (JOI)-6 months (JOI-182 days or
    L+1614 days). The duration of this cruise phase is 791 days, which is
    over 2 years.

  JUPITER APPROACH
  ----------------
    The Jupiter Approach phase lasts the final 6 months of cruise before
    Jupiter Orbit Insertion and is an opportunity for final Flight System and
    instrument checkouts as well as science observations to start exercising
    the ground system and Flight System, although orbit insertion preparations
    limit instrument activities close to JOI. There are more frequent
    maneuvers approaching JOI, starting with a TCM at JOI-5 months, and
    correspondingly increasing DSN coverage. The 178-day Jupiter Approach
    phase is preceded by a 26-month Outer Cruise phase.   Jupiter Approach
    starts 3 months after the project is fully staffed up in preparation for
    JOI and the 1.3 years of science orbits.   The phase ends at JOI-4 days,
    which is the start of the JOI critical sequence.

  JUPITER ORBIT INSERTION
  -----------------------
    The JOI phase encompasses the JOI critical sequence. It begins 4 days
    before the start of the orbit insertion maneuver and ends 1 hour after the
    start.  JOI, the second critical event of the mission, occurs at closest
    approach to Jupiter, and slows the spacecraft enough to let it be captured
    by Jupiter into a 53.8-day orbit.  A cleanup burn at JOI+8.6d during the
    Capture Orbits phase is required to clean up JOI maneuver execution
    errors. DSN coverage is continuous during the JOI phase.

  PRIME MISSION
  --------------
    The Science Orbits phase includes Orbit 0 through Orbit 35.  Orbit N is
    defined from apojove (AJ) N-1 through apojove N, and includes perijove
    (PJ) N.  Orbit numbering starts before the Science Orbits phase.  JOI
    occurs at PJ0, so Orbit 0 lasts from PJ0 through AJ0 (including a JOI 
    cleanup maneuver at JOI+8.6d).  Orbit 1 includes PJ1, and runs from AJ0
    through AJ1. Orbit 2 includes PJ2, and runs from AJ1 through AJ2. Orbit
    3 includes PJ3, and runs from AJ2 through AJ3. Early orbital science was
    baselined in Orbits 0, 1, 2, and 3, except for the JOI keepout zone.
    Orbit 4 is the first science orbit. It includes PJ4 (and the first OTM at 
    PJ4+7.5h), and runs from AJ3 through AJ4.  The flyby of Ganymede (PJ34)
    reduced the orbital period from about 53 days to about 43 days.  Small
    (up to 8 m/s) orbit trim maneuvers (OTMs) are planned after each set of 
    perijove science observations, at PJ+4h, PJ+6h, or PJ+7.5h in Orbits 4
    through 34, to target the perijove longitude required for science
    observations in the next orbit. 

    Radiation accumulation increases substantially as the orbital line of
    apsides rotates and perijove latitude increases from 3 degrees at JOI to
    36 (TBD) degrees at PJ35.

  EXTENDED MISSION
  ----------------
  Using the same orbit numbering scheme as in the Prime Mission, the Extended
  Mission begins on 1 August 2021 and extends to orbit 76, through September 
  2025.  The Extended Mission includes a close Europa flyby during orbit 45
  which reduces the orbital period to about 38 days. Close flybys of Io
  occur on orbits 57 and 58, reducing the period to about 33 days. Note that
  times are from the reference trajectory and are not be be construed as 
  as-flown, reconstructed times.

=======================
  
  Prime Mission Objectives
  ========================

  Juno&apos;s science objectives encompass four scientific themes:
  origin, interior structure, atmospheric composition and dynamics, and polar
  magnetosphere.  These are based on Appendix E to the New Frontiers Program
  Plan: Program Level Requirements for the Juno Project (PLRA).  Juno 
  addresses science objectives central to three NASA Science divisions: Solar
  System (Planetary), Earth-Sun System (Heliophysics), and Universe 
  (Astrophysics).  

  Juno&apos;s primary science goal of understanding the formation,
  evolution, and structure of Jupiter is directly related to the conditions in
  the early solar system which led to the formation of our planetary system. 
  The mass of Jupiter&apos;s solid core and the abundance of heavy elements in the
  atmosphere discriminate among models for giant planet formation.  Juno
  constrains the core mass by mapping the gravitational field, and measures
  through microwave sounding the global abundances of oxygen (water) and
  nitrogen (ammonia). Juno reveals the history of Jupiter by mapping the
  gravitational and magnetic fields with sufficient resolution to constrain
  Jupiter&apos;s interior structure, the source region of the magnetic field, and
  the nature of deep convection. By sounding deep into Jupiter&apos;s atmosphere,
  Juno determines to what depth the belts and zones penetrate.  Juno provides
  the first survey and exploration of the three-dimensional structure of
  Jupiter&apos;s polar magnetosphere.  The overall goal of the Juno mission is to
  improve our understanding of the solar system by understanding the origin
  and evolution of Jupiter.


  ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION
  -----------------------
  Juno investigates the formation and origin of Jupiter&apos;s atmosphere and the
  potential migration of planets through the measurement of Jupiter&apos;s global
  abundance of oxygen (water) and nitrogen (ammonia).

<field name="data_set_description">Data Set Overview
    =================

    This data set contains count rate tables derived from the Juno
    Stellar Reference Unit (SRU) EDR images.

    This data set uses the Committee on Data Management
    and Computation (CODMAC) data level numbering system.
    The SRU count rate tables are considered Level 5 or Derived Data
    (equivalent to NASA Level 1C). 


    Processing
    ==========

    SRU count rate tables are produced in &apos;.CSV&apos; format and consist of
    comma-delimited values.


    Data
    ====
      
    SRU count rate tables (CRTs) contain derived electron count rates from 
    a series of SRU images acquired during an orbit. The process by which 
    these are derived is explained in the Software Interface Specification 
    (SIS): Stellar Reference Unit Standard Data Products. Typically these SRU 
    images are taken near perijove. Image processing includes geometric 
    correction, star identification and removal, hot pixel removal, and count 
    rate detection. One of two methods of count rate quantification is used, 
    depending on the noise level observed in the image. Details of this 
    processing are described in the SIS.

    One count rate table (CRT) will be produced for each orbit. Within one 
    orbit&apos;s table, each row will represent the derived count rate from 
    one SRU image. The count rate values are derived from one of the two 
    measurement techniques described in the SIS, indicated by a valid value 
    in either column 4 or 5. The measurement technique will be chosen based 
    on the overall radiation-induced noise level of that image. 

    There are six fields in the table. The columns are as follows: SCET (UTC) 
    corresponding to midpoint of SRU image exposure; SCLK corresponding to 
    midpoint of SRU image exposure (following conversion from the native 
    format provided in the Event Verification Record (EVR) which telemeters 
    the SRU-generated image time tag); Identification number of the SRU that 
    the image was taken with; Detected count rate (&apos;cluster&apos; counts per 
    square cm of CCD area per second), if valid; Derived rate of deposited 
    noise signal (&apos;DN&apos; per pixel per second), if valid; Derived count rate 
    per square cm of CCD area per second using one of the previous methods 
    that is valid. Column 4 or 5 will have a value of 1.0E-31 if that 
    measurement technique is not valid; in that case the other column will 
    have a valid value.

    Each table product has two parts: the table itself with the extension 
    of &apos;CSV&apos; and a detached label with an extension of &apos;LBL&apos;. 

    Refer to the Stellar Reference Unit Standard Data Products Software 
    Interface Specification (SIS) for further details on these data products.</field>

<field name="description">Target Overview
      ===============
      The Io Plasma Torus (IPT) is a cloud of charged particles in orbit
      around Jupiter and centered on the centrifugal equator. It extends
      from inside Io&apos;s orbit (about 5 Rj) out to around Europa&apos;s orbit,
      though exact estimates of the outer boundary vary.
 
      The IPT consists primarily of ionized sulfur and oxygen, and
      electrons. The main source of these particles is Io, though Europa
      may also contribute. The particles orbit Jupiter at a velocity
      which lags slightly behind the corrotation velocity.
 
 
      Target Parameters
      =================
      The parameters relevant to the torus are difficult to quantify as
      they vary with radial distance, Jovian latitude, Jovian longitude,
      and even with time. The following description (adapted from
      [BAGENAL1994]) describes the characteristics of five radially
      defined regions:
 
        The inner torus 5-5.4 Rj. The plasma is cold (~1 eV) with few
        suprathermal ions or electrons. The composition is dominated by
        S+ (45-75% of charge fraction) and O+ (20-45% charge fraction)
        with small, quantities of O++ and SO2+.
 
        The precipice region 5.4-5.6 Rj. There are sharp changes in the
        slope of the number of ions per shell of magnetic flux (NL^2)
        and in the composition. The supra thermal ions comprise &gt;10% of
        the density.
 
        The ribbon region 5.6-6 Rj. Here are the highest densities
        (&gt;3000 cm^-3). The temperature and composition (for &gt;5.75 Rj
        ~40% O+, ~17% S++, ~10% S+ of charge fraction) are similar to
        the rest of the warm torus (&gt;5.7 Rj).
 
        The ledge region 6-7.5 Rj. This is the uniform region of the
        warm torus, where there are gradual changes in density,
        composition, and temperature.
 
        The ramp region &gt; 7.5 Rj. There is a drop in NL^2, perhaps due
        to impoundment of the torus material by the middle
        magnetospheric ring current. The current sheet begins to affect
        the magnetic field. The ions change in composition towards
        higher ionization state and higher oxygen fraction. Suprathermal
        ions are diffusing inwards. Europa is a possible source of
        plasma in this region.

      Results from Voyager 1 investigations of the IPT include
      [BRIDGEETAL1979A] (PLS), [BROADFOOTETAL1979] (UVS), and
      [WARWICKETAL1979A] and [BIRMINGHAMETAL1981] (PRA electron
      studies). [BROWNETAL1983] gives a post Pioneer and Voyager
      description of the IPT&apos;s characteristics. [BAGENAL1994] models the
      plasma conditions between 5 and 10 Rj using updated analyses of
      Voyager 1 observations. [SCHNEIDER&amp;TRAUGE1995] discuss IPT
      asymmetries. Periodicities in the brightness of the torus are
      discussed in [DESSLER&amp;SANDEL1992], and [BROWN1995].</field>

       ELEMENTS-PLANET
       The 1989 Astronomical Almanac, page E3.
 
       MAGMOMENT-PLANET
       C.T. RUSSELL, CH. 5 IN GEOMAGNETISM, VOL. 2 (ACADEMIC PRESS)
 
       MEANSOLARDAY-PLANET
       Derived from three other target constants catalog elements:
       REVOLUTION_PERIOD (RP), SIDEREAL_ROTATION_PERIOD (SRP), and
       ROTATION_DIRECTION_TYPE (RDT)  as follows:
       If RDT = PROGRADE, then MSD = (RP * SRP)/(RP - SRP).
       If RDT = RETROGRADE, then MSD = (RP * SRP)/(RP + SRP).
 
       ORBSEMIMAJAX-PLANET
       Derived from data from The 1989 Astronomical Almanac,
       converting Mean Distance on page E3 to km using the value
       for Unit Distance found on page K6.
 
       PERIARGANG-PLANET
       Derived from data from The 1989 Astronomical Almanac as
       LAN-LP, where LAN is the Ascending Node Longitude and LP is
       the Longitude of Perihelion, both from page E3.

       Taken or derived from REPORT OF THE IAU WORKING GROUP ON
       CARTOGRAPHIC COORDINATES AND ROTATIONAL ELEMENTS OF THE
       PLANETS AND SATELLITES, 1988 as follows:
       Given Mean Radius (MR), Equatorial Radius (ER), and Polar
       Radius (PR), then this catalog defines the following:
       A_AXIS_RADIUS        = ER
       B_AXIS_RADIUS        = ER
       C_AXIS_RADIUS        = ER

       Derived from data from The 1989 Astronomical Almanac as
       360/n where n is the Daily Motion from page E3.
 
       ROTATION-PLANET
       The 1989 Astronomical Almanac, page E87.
       The Astronomical Almanac, 1989, page C3.
 
       SURFGRAV-PLANET
       Derived from data in THE 1989 ASTRONOMICAL ALMANAC and the
       1988 REPORT OF THE IAU WORKING GROUP ON CARTOGRAPHIC
       COORDINATES as (G * MASS)/(MR * MR) where MR is MEAN RADIUS
       from this catalog, MASS comes from page E88, and the

<field name="description">Target Overview
  ===============
    The Solar System consists of the Sun, all celestial bodies orbiting
    the Sun (including the planets, their satellites, asteroids, comets,
    and meteroids), and the interplanetary medium (including dust)
    extending to the heliopause. This target is primarily used by the
    PDS to describe data acquired during the interplanetary cruise
    portion of planetary missions. The assignment of the &apos;SOLAR SYSTEM&apos;
    target to a data set does not imply that the data within the data
    set are unmodified by the interstellar medium or other sources
    outside of the Solar System.
 
  Target Parameters
  =================
    None of the normal parameters that the PDS maintains about other
    targets apply to the Solar System, except possibly mass. The Sun
    (1.9891E30 Kg) contains 99.86% of the mass of the Solar System and
    most of the remaining mass is contained in Jupiter. The Solar System
    Barycenter moves in a nearly circular orbit about the center of the
    Galaxy (which lies about 8500 parsecs away in the constellation
    Sagittarius) at a mean speed of about 220 km/sec.</field>
